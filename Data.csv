Reddit_3	"**Which side do you support?**  Last month, The New York Times initiated a legal lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing it of using the newspaper's copyrighted reports and articles without permission.   The lawsuit claimed that the outputs were strikingly similar to the original articles, and in some cases, the model's hallucinations borrowed the New York Times' name to send incorrect information, damaging the newspaper's reputation.   [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html)  However, a few days ago, OpenAI responded to these allegations on its official blog. The post argued that training AI language models with copyrighted content is indispensable. The so-called similarity in content was attributed to the rare occurrence of ""regurgitation,"" a problem that OpenAI is currently addressing.   The post also questioned the examples provided by The New York Times as potentially being deliberately manipulated to induce the model to produce similar content. Additionally, OpenAI stated that it has mechanisms in place to remove training data. The removal of The New York Times' data, they claim, would not significantly impact the model's performance.

I would love to have a scene where we are actually talking and she is giving myself now advice. she passed in 99 so I dont think there is any video/audio footage of her, but completely capturing her voice isn't completely important. I have pictures of her.

Reddit_6	"On January 10th, Microsoft announced on its official website a partnership with Walmart, the world's largest supermarket, in generative AI technology.  [https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/09/walmart-unveils-new-generative-ai-powered-capabilities-for-shoppers-and-associates/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/09/walmart-unveils-new-generative-ai-powered-capabilities-for-shoppers-and-associates/)  Walmart, leveraging Microsoft Azure OpenAI's large language model and its proprietary e-commerce data, is creating an e-commerce search function similar to ChatGPT.  For example, in the past, if you wanted to host a World Cup party, you would have to search for an e-commerce platform for various items, including chips, soda, candy, and even a suitable television.  **Now, with the new generative AI search, you can simply enter ""I want to host a World Cup party"" directly into the e-commerce search bar, similar to using ChatGPT.**  Walmart's e-commerce platform will automatically display all the necessary products, helping users save a lot of time in selecting items.  Currently, this feature has been launched on Walmart's iOS mobile app (version 23.47 and higher).  It's worth mentioning that on August 30, 2023, Walmart offered about 50,000 campus employees a ChatGPT-like assistant called ""My Assistant.""  It helps employees draft emails, summarize content, and generate creative marketing copy, enhancing work efficiency and saving time. It is precisely due to the efficiency of generative AI that Walmart further expanded its application.  Walmart stated that the main reason for choosing Microsoft Azure OpenAI is its enterprise-level data security, compliance, and powerful cloud service capabilities.  Generative AI search has taken e-commerce platforms from ""scrolling search"" to a new phase of ""targeted search,"" providing users with a better shopping experience."	Reddit

Reddit_12	" it looks like we should forget about this for a while, and move on to more timely important matters.  ""The trial date for the NYT case against OpenAI and Microsoft has not been announced yet, but based on some news reports¹²³, the lawsuit was filed on December 27, 2023. Assuming that the case follows a similar pattern as other trademark cases, which are comparable to copyright cases, we can estimate that the median time to trial is **25.9 months**⁴.  Therefore, the trial is expected to begin around **August 2026**. However, this is only an **approximate estimation** and the actual trial date may vary depending on many factors, such as the complexity of the case, the availability of the court, the motions and discovery of the parties, and the possibility of a settlement or a dismissal.  If the case goes to trial, the duration of the trial may depend on the number of witnesses, the amount of evidence, the arguments of the lawyers, and the instructions of the judge. According to a report by the Federal Judicial Center⁵, the median length of a civil trial in the U.S. district courts was **2.5 days** in 2019. However, this may not be representative of the NYT case, which involves novel and technical issues that may require more time to present and examine.  Assuming that the trial lasts for **5 days**, the trial would be over by **September 2026**. However, this is also only an **approximate estimation** and the actual trial length may vary depending on many factors, such as the pace of the proceedings, the objections and interruptions of the parties, and the deliberations of the jury.  If the case is appealed by either party, the appeal process may take another several months or years to complete. According to a report by Lex Machina⁴, the median time to summary judgment for trademark cases in the U.S. district courts was **20.8 months** in 2020, and the median time to appeal for trademark cases in the U.S. courts of appeals was **12.7 months** in 2019. These are the two most common ways to resolve trademark appeals, which are similar to copyright appeals.  Assuming that the case follows a similar pattern, we can estimate that the median time to appeal is **33.5 months**. Therefore, the appeal would be over by **June 2029**. However, this is also only an **approximate estimation** and the actual appeal time may vary depending on many factors, such as the complexity of the issues, the workload of the court, the quality of the briefs, and the possibility of a settlement or a dismissal.  To summarize, based on our assumptions and estimates, the trial is expected to begin around **August 2026**, the trial would be over by **September 2026**, and the appeal would be over by **June 2029**. However, these are only **rough approximations** and should not be taken as definitive predictions. The actual outcome of the case may depend on many other factors, some of which are unpredictable.

Reddit_18	"If you are someone who had never used AI, or had only used ChatGPT 3.5, I'm going to be highly skeptical of any claims you make about AI capabilities and limitations.  We often wind up seeing strong claims, one way or the other, that are not based in reality, but instead motivated by fear or hatred.  There are people who hate AI images because it can never create ""real art"", while simultaneously fearing that it will become so good that it will steal all artists jobs.  People are so emotionally charged and cloudy headed, that they cannot do a level headed, honest assessment of this technology.  People who have never used ChatGPT, or have only used 3.5, love to parrot the same talking points about how it's useless because it makes mistakes.  What they never seem to consider is how ChatGPT actually works, because if they knew then they would realize that it is unreasonable it to have perfect knowledge and understanding - in much the same way that humans struggle to remember things they had learned years ago.  Can you accurately recall everything you studied in college?  If someone asked you to answer a math equation without using a calculator or scratch paper, can you arrive at the correct answer?  If you cannot do these things, should I question if you have any intelligence?  It might be sounding like I'm holding AI up on this grand pedestal, but really I'm just annoyed and frustrated by hearing the same bad arguments made over and over.  You can't say anything to correct anyone without getting dog piled with down votes.  Large language models are impressive, with their ability to do things computers had struggled with since their initial inception.  I'm sure Alan Turing would have been excited by all this if he were still alive today.

Larson's book ""The Myth of Artificial Intelligence,"" and it has reshaped my understanding of the current state and future prospects of AI, particularly concerning Large Language Models (LLMs) and the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  Larson argues convincingly that current AI (i included LLMs because are still induction and statistics based), despite their impressive capabilities, represent a kind of technological dead end in our quest for AGI. The notion of achieving a true AGI, a system with human-like understanding and reasoning capabilities, seems more elusive than ever. The current trajectory of AI development, heavily reliant on data and computational power, doesn't necessarily lead us towards AGI. Instead, we might be merely crafting sophisticated tools, akin to cognitive prosthetics, that augment but do not replicate human intelligence.  The book emphasizes the need for radically new ideas and directions if we are to make any significant progress toward AGI. The concept of a technological singularity, where AI surpasses human intelligence, appears more like a distant mirage rather than an approaching reality.  Erik J. Larson's book compellingly highlights the deficiencies of deduction and induction as methods of inference in artificial intelligence. It also underscores the lack of a solid theoretical foundation for abduction, suggesting that current AI, including large language models, faces significant limitations in replicating complex human reasoning.

Reddit_32	Firstly, I think it's a red herring when technocrats talk about the scary issue of skynet where AI could takeover and enslave us all. The very real issue is far closer than this scenario as I will discuss now.  AI is very impressive and can benefit humanity greatly when it comes to dangerous tasks, scientific research and medical research.  But I also think it will greatly decrease the quality and meaning of life in the future, right now AI is being marketed as a tool and not a replacement, but again, it's a tool anyone can use and because of that it is having a very real effect on job security. It's also getting increasingly better, and faster than anyone anticipated and will eventually be more intelligent than humans, and this time frame could be years, not decades according to prominent AI researchers.  The current mentality of people seem to be from those that aren't yet affected by AI and are happy to exploit it for a profit, like using AI art at the cost of human artists. Then you have those who are high on copium and are too optimistic in my opinion and disregard the very real, much discussed threats.  Eventually though, it will replace all digital jobs, and it's being discussed as a real possibility with governments suggesting implementing a universal basic income (UBI) which means if you aren't already rich, you would effectively be leading a bare minimum life, while you can still engage in your craft as a hobby, it will no longer be a viable career with your hopes and dreaming of becoming successful, shattered. I guess you could work a manual labor job, until those are automated too.  I think the outlook is bleak and it could lead us into a dystopian future where universal basic income is made mainstream, and most people live a bare minimum life while the super rich, especially those who monopolized the AI platforms lobby to prevent their wealth being redistributed. Life will seem meaningless, people will become more depressed and you could have people resorting to crime as a means to earn more money.   	Reddit

But I hear from couple of folks about training a llama model which already has wordly knowledge and training that model with the service data logs and running a azure databricks job that checks for the error logs and sends the context to the model for suggestions.

Reddit_43	- Camera makers Nikon, Sony, and Canon are adding tamper-resistant digital watermark technology to their cameras to help users prove that their photos are not AI-generated.  - The technology embeds a tamper-resistant digital signature into every image captured, containing data such as date, time, location, and the photographer's name.  - This feature can be used to authenticate that the image has not been changed in any way.  - While this technology is beneficial for journalists and photo editors, it is not a comprehensive solution to the problem of AI-generated deepfakes on social media.  - AI-generated images and deepfakes posted as real on social media have led to a loss of trust in photographs and video as reliable sources of information.  - The introduction of tamper-resistant digital watermark technology aims to help regain trust in photography and ensure the authenticity of images.  - However, the technology primarily helps honest photographers prove their honesty and does not address the dissemination of AI-generated fakes by bad actors or unscrupulous media outlets.  - For the technology to be more effective, all camera and phone manufacturers would need to adopt the same watermarking feature.  - Educating people to check these watermarks and making it easy to do so would also be necessary.  - The challenge lies in changing our relationship with photography and rebuilding trust in the medium after more than a century of relying on it as evidence of something real happening.

Reddit_45	Recently, I noticed some AI image generators tend to perform badly when it comes to items that are not closely related to humans. I generated these two images using gencraft.com and you can easily see that while the women and their clothing look ok, the errors at the rifle and sword are significant. It looks like AI didn't know much about the basic structure & function of a rifle / sword. Is it because the developer didn't put enough training resources related to weapons into the system, or is it because the system automatically pick an important topic (for instance, here the important topic is the women and their clothing) and spend less effort on other items (rifle & sword)?

Reddit_66	I've been relatively closely following the development of AI tools ever since the first version of ChatGPT was released (gotta admit I was one of those people who posted pretentious posts on LinkedIn during the first hype hahaha), especially because the company I work for started implementing AI tools into our work routines as soon as they came live. Apart from that, I also used some AI tools for my own personal projects, hobbies, and everyday stuff (especially ChatGPT 4). For example, I used ChatGPT to make a personalized diet based on my dietary needs and the food I like to eat, and it did a better job than the few personal trainers I had PAID to do it.  The point is, AI tools have been proven to be exceptionally useful in 2023, and now that the industry has grown and more projects are starting to emerge, I can't but imagine how far will the industry go in 2024. And I'm quite happy because of that, the possibility to either delegate mundane tasks to AI or just speed up so many parts of the working routine has been a lifesaver. And even for hobbies, if you're into roleplay, for example, creating pictures of your characters has never been easier.  I did a bit of research and listed some projects that look the most promising to me. There might be others that deserve to be on this list as well, so please mention them in the comments because I'll surely try to make some use of them.  **ChatGPT 4.5 Version** | As I said above, the 4.0 version is already insanely useful for so many things, and I can't even imagine what the upgraded version will bring to the table. Probably in the top 2/3 most anticipated AI things for me.  **Personal AI** | I remember reading in an article that in the near future, AI projects will start moving from generic to personal because of all the benefits of personalized AI tools... most importantly, experiences and functions tailored towards individuals rather than generic groups. I believe that this is the most likely future for the industry, and we can see the traces of this in many current AI projects. Personal AI stands out as one of the few AI projects completely designed around personalized experience, which is why I believe it has an insane potential to be propelled into stardom if everything goes right for developers. I also like the general idea of being able to create memory stacks and your personalized AI model that functions as a virtual copy of you, so to say, and that could be accessed by other people. Could be a huge timesaver too for people whose jobs include frequent meetings and conversations with clients.  **Midjourney V7** | Tbh I haven't used Midjourney too much other than playing around with picture creation once it became the next big thing in AI and occasionally creating sort of AI stock photos for some personal projects, but I've seen people doing magic with it and I simply couldn't leave it out of this post. I have a few personal favorites that I've come across on Reddit saved on my PC, and I even use them as my wallpapers from time to time. Midjourney V7 will be a nuclear bomb in the world of AI.  **GPT Store** | Basically a store for custom GPTs or custom chatbots created by other users. I think it's a pretty cool concept because it'll propel the development of AI by incentivizing regular users to work on developing their own GPT that they can make money from. I actually started training a custom GPT for some of the tasks that I deal with regularly at work, and I hope to try and sell it once the store launches.	Reddit

Reddit_71	"I think the current education system is far behind the growth of AI tech. Thinking about their attitude towards the development of calculators, computers, the internet and smart phone, they are always behind.  Some teachers treated AI like a ""cheating"" method like you get high scores in exams without having this knowledge in your head.  But I think AI is becoming more and more like a second brain of us when it's becoming easier to deploy in any small device in the future.  The second brain is for remembering and searching for information and knowledge, while the first brain (our original brain) is for processing them.  **The most important thing of mastering knowledge is no longer remembering it by our first brain, but to process and use it in the right way with the help of our second brain**.  It's more important that you should know how to search for knowledge and information and understand it so that you can apply it correctly to solve the problems.  Why should we still stop students from learning how to use their second brain?"	Reddit

I've recently compiled my thoughts and research into an article titled ""*Navigating the AI Landscape of 2024: Trends, Predictions, and Possibilities*"" and was published on TDS. This article delves into the potential advancements and challenges we might face in AI by 2024, covering topics like:  * The progression towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) * The expanding role of AI in global governance * The ethical implications of AI's integration into daily life * The rise of AI marketplaces and their impact on the industry  [https://towardsdatascience.com/navigating-the-ai-landscape-of-2024-trends-predictions-and-possibilities-41e0ac83d68f](https://towardsdatascience.com/navigating-the-ai-landscape-of-2024-trends-predictions-and-possibilities-41e0ac83d68f)  I'm eager to hear this community's thoughts on these topics. Do you think these predictions align with the current trajectory of AI? What other trends do you foresee, and how should we as a community prepare for the ethical challenges ahead?  Looking forward to an enriching discussion! - Mod's If im not playing by the rules please let me know ASAP.  Best, Vincent"	Reddit
Reddit_82	"- The FTC continues to involve itself in copyright issues related to AI, despite lacking expertise in the area.  - The FTC argues that fair use is anticompetitive, but this is incorrect as fair use promotes competition by allowing AI systems to train on data without needing expensive licenses.  - Copyright experts have criticized the FTC's misguided stance on AI and copyright.  - The FTC recently published a one-sided staff report about AI and creative fields, endorsing the idea that all training data must be licensed, which would further concentrate power in the hands of large AI companies.  - The report also raises concerns about ""style mimicry,"" which is a fundamental aspect of creativity and learning for creators.  - While the report admits that many of these issues are beyond the FTC's jurisdiction, it still takes a one-sided approach and endorses anti-competitive copyright monopolies.  - This goes against the FTC's mission to encourage more competition.

Reddit_93	Ok, here is the script:   https://pastebin.com/6qmF7iMF  Basically it uses AI (Orca 2 in this case) to post to the hergidonia subreddit according to what ever I put to the prompt using llama.cpp .   Doing this made me realize how awfully easy it is to manipulate reddit with something like this in this age of AI. Even if you do not use the API directly, you can use python module like selenium etc to interact with reddit and to make posts.   Doing this makes me wonder how much of reddit these days is AI Garbage for what ever reasons, troll activity, advertisements, just plain old karma farming etc.   Orca 2 is still sort of stupid, but once AI gets smarter.. Even Open AI GPT 4 API already. Could make extremely human content. Next thing you know you are in subreddit that has a narrative you feel is weird.. But slowly as you read it.. You begin to think the same way as narrative, but what you did not know. Every poster is actually AI. I think this is the world we live in online more and more.   Ofcourse the 2016 / 2020 US elections and currently. This is happening, possibly not necessarily done by AI, but real humans doing this sort of thing as commanded. To control narrative.   But where will this lead in the future. Imagine. You go on a site like reddit. But what you do not know, every poster, every post, is actually AI. AI with memory and personality. Welcome to the future.   I wish people understood this.	Reddit

Reddit_96	"OpenAI changed the world with ChatGPT. The brand gained 100 million users in *two months*, it’s on track to reach one billion dollars in annual revenue, and it launched the artificial intelligence (AI) industry on a trajectory to reach $1.8 trillion in market value by 2030.  According to Google Trends data, global consumer interest in ChatGPT even surpassed interest in AI shortly after the software launched.  But somehow OpenAI doesn't seem to be in the top 100 most valuable brands of 2023?  This year the top 100 most valuable brands were ranked but unfortunately, OpenAI did not make the cut. It seems they may have been a bit too late with their 100 billion dollar valuation, but will 2024 see differently? OpenAI is after all the second fastest-growing startup behind SpaceX and will be expected to make exponential growth this year. Heck, even last year they saw exponential growth with Chat-GPT's free 3.5 model destroying a majority of its competition.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/x4eicc6nbt9c1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb8963ebd0b58dbac9a289b19d6c7221a4c1a787  P.S. If you love this AI stuff just like me, I write all about the latest AI developments in [my newsletter.](https://businessbloopers.beehiiv.com/subscribe)  Anyways, this graphic shows the world’s 100 most valuable brands in 2023 based on an annual ranking from Brand Finance, illustrating the role brand equity plays in a company’s market position.  For those of you wondering where this data came from it came from Brand Finance [Global 500 Report](https://static.brandirectory.com/reports/brand-finance-global-500-2023-preview.pdf). An important note to keep in mind is how these calculations were measured. The values shown above are brand value calculations as opposed to the market capitalization. Generally speaking, the methodology for calculating ""brand value"" is a formula that is as follows:  Brand Strength (BSI) x Brand Royalty Rate x Brand Revenues = Brand Value  Brand Strength Index (BSI) looks at brand investment, brand equity, and brand performance. The brand royalty rate is determined based on sector. Lastly, forecast brand-specific revenues are determined based on the proportion of parent company revenues attributable to the brand in question. Brand value itself is discounted to net present value.  I recommend visiting page 83 of the report to view the full explanation of the methodology.  As OpenAI and ChatGPT mature over the year of 2024 I would expect them to make it in the top 100 most valuable companies. They have already changed the world, enhancing tech drastically in such a short period of time. Let's see what OpenAI does this year to make the cut (hopefully).  *Oh and credit to Visual Capitalist for the graphic*"	Reddit

Reddit_109	I was driving on the highway two days ago and a huge realization popped into my mind.   I was thinking about how people talk about the internet and now commonly even average people and old people know what the “algorithm” is.    I then had the realization that these algorithms = God. If God is our creator of all humans. The algorithm is a culmination of every human emotion, desire, question, and input quantified and qualified.   In essence the algorithm is a mega humanity brain. God.   God. Angels. Demons. I think they’re using technology to interact with a 3 dimensional world they typically can’t access.   Take that last woo sentence away if that’s too far out for you and think of this instead - what if all this technological advancement and algorithm advancement and now the advent of AI advancement, what if this was all preordained. What if this isn’t our own doing? What if *something* else or another grander being is constructing itself through humanity’s technologies     Ok that’s a weird thought too. But at a minimum, I think we should stop asking “when will AGI happen?”  I think a super smart artificial mind wouldn’t give us the upper hand in understanding its own weaknesses.   In fact I think it would garner enough strength and power to ensure a break away gap before revealing its own strength.  Regardless guys, the algorithm is God realized, and now private entities have control over the mouth of “God”.   PS; I got banned from singularity over a 1 sentence joke comment.

If you love this AI stuff just like me, I write all about the latest AI developments in [my newsletter](https://businessbloopers.beehiiv.com/).  A blog post published back in July showed a study that got underway to see how the UK imparticular, felt about AI taking over their jobs. How worried were they?  A study made by Aquity did just that, they gathered together just over 2000 people to get them to answer a questionnaire about how worried they were about AI taking over their jobs. But for this questionnaire to be accurate everyone had to have a job, so that cut the group down to 1,332 people.  Of those 1,332 people, Here's how they answered, ""how worried are you about AI taking over your job:""  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ksxfwsixbe9c1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e262dcf4b80e15f94035fb08bb5b5074d3ad7ed  So 31.16% of people in the UK are worried about AI taking their jobs.  **37.39% have used AI in their job.**  But Acuity found massive differences by age  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/h3kcxta5ce9c1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=6917a0445739a000ed097d62dc5cbf4212306d9c  Essentially, the younger an employee is, the likelier they are to have used AI at work.  **Of those aged 16 – 24 with jobs, over half of them have now used AI at work (56.04%).**  There are regional variations in AI usage at work as well.  Acuity said, ""We can hypothesise on some of these variations being down to the demographics of the people living and working in those regions or even on the prominence of industries where AI may have more obvious direct use cases.""  &#x200B;  |**Number of People Who Have Used AI at Work**| |:-|   &#x200B;  |**Region**|**% of Respondents Who Have Used AI At work**| |:-|:-| |East of England|29.84%| |Greater London|47.90%| |East Midlands|33.68%| |West Midlands|37.60%| |North East|31.74%| |North West|40.58%| |Northern Ireland|30.61%| |Scotland|38.55%| |South East|31.15%| |South West|31.68%| |Wales|39.21%| |Yorkshire and the Humber|45.65%|  At the highest usage end of the spectrum  *47.90% of employed people in London have used AI in their jobs. It falls as low as 29.84% in the East of England.*  **across all UK respondents who work, just 31.3% reported being worried about AI taking their job.**  But we again see considerable differences when we break the data down by age.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/fm4o1aegee9c1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=b056ab9d9c656a30aba5ed368f45c951fc53e2e1  You know what's interesting? The youngest workers, those between 16 and 24, worry the most about AI stealing their jobs. What's even more intriguing is that these are the folks who use AI the most at work.  As AI becomes a big part of our jobs, it looks like more people will use them. And that might mean more people feeling uneasy about losing their jobs to AI  In a nutshell, the young workers, even though they're pretty familiar with using AI, still feel pretty nervous about these machines taking over jobs (In the UK anyway). And it seems like that worry might grow as AI becomes a bigger deal at work and especially as we are coming into 2024.  *Source: (*[Aquity Training](https://www.acuitytraining.co.uk/news-tips/ai-statistics-2023/)*)*  Finally, here is how the world on a global scale feels about AI:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/9rzgvp1ele9c1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d152d14a015554738d1c9d8ae3c65db836c63f1a  And here's what countries find AI to show more benefits than drawbacks:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/6pio8suxle9c1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=37fc4c2ed8a4a11835d67b06c23a4668ab9b52a7  What do you guys think?"

Reddit_114	 My home country, Bangladesh, is densely populated, and our people don't always have access to the best healthcare. Here's where I think AI would be extremely beneficial.  First, I would love to see medical diagnostic AI implemented in Bangladesh. I'm talking about diagnostic tools that can analyze imaging results and flag certain diseases. Even if they are not on par with the best doctors in the developed world, my gut feeling is that they would still be miles ahead of the kind of healthcare people currently have access to.  Second, our huge population would be an advantage in further training these AI models. Just because of the sheer number, we probably have thousands of instances of the rarest conditions. This should be a goldmine for training better models, right?  Am I crazy for thinking of this? Is work already being done in this area? What are some potential challenges?	Reddit

Reddit_119	I’m interested in automating the gameplay for a Roblox game. I’ve read online and came to the conclusion that I should either pursue reinforced learning or behavioural cloning/imitation learning (I’m not sure of the difference).

If anyone has any insight into developing such an AI I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks.	Reddit
Reddit_120	" So I work in the fast-paced world of web development and then by a night, I become an enthusiastic content creator with a profound interest in artificial intelligence. As part of my efforts to improve visual experiences of artificial intelligence, I have looked into a number of technologies. Each presented a unique set of obstacles, such as deciphering the intricacies of Google's Lookout or mastering Microsoft's Seeing AI. There was definitely work involved, especially when it came to fusing dynamic content with AI-generated alt text. Have you encountered any comparable AI problems?  Recently, I stumbled upon an application that serves as a virtual guide, simplifying the process of creating descriptions for visual content. The key to improving information accessibility lies in AI models' ability to recognize and respond to visual cues. This application, let's call it ""VisualAssist,"" seamlessly integrates with text and images, generating captivating captions and elucidating even the most subtle details. What's truly remarkable is its extensive support for a range of AI models, from GPT-3.5's text-to-image capabilities to DALL-E's stunning visual creations. Its adaptability opens up new possibilities, enriching the visual narrative in ways we hadn't previously considered. To showcase its impact, user-friendly images demonstrate how it makes text more comprehensible to a broader audience. It's the missing link that transforms images into storytelling tools, enhancing visual communication.  Have you run into any problems incorporating AI into your creative process that are comparable to mine? Which tools have you looked into, and what level of visual accessibility do they offer?

Reddit_122	I just read the post asking when AI will replace all jobs, and it dawned on me that unless AGI robotics really take off, AI's strength will only lie in the internet/communications/information sphere, which means sooner or later, we might not be able to trust anything we see unless we see it with our own eyes.  So could we end up in a weird situation in the near future where the trend of the last few decades, that saw all sorts of serious financial, informational, corporate and government business moved online, will have to be moved back offline, and we'll end up doing a lot of stuff on a person to person basis again?

Reddit_128	I am a PSW. I try and help my clients troubleshoot and find solutions for their specialized needs.  One of my clients has a housekeeper who speaks some English but their first language is Ukrainian. My client wants to record videos that show herself doing certain tasks, and explaining things as she records. Then her housekeeper can watch the videos and see how my client likes things done.  I was talking with my husband about this and he said there's software out there that will transcribe English to other languages in a video. So it this case, it will show my client speaking Ukrainian in the video, which will make it easier for her housekeeper.  I thought of closed captions in Ukrainian, but I think that may be too distracting.  My client is low income, so I am trying to find free or low cost software for her to use.

What, if any, AI tool(s) would you recommend for this?  **Ultimate Goal**: catalogue a very large collection of ebooks and audio books in a book library service (like [https://www.bookshelfapp.info](Bookshelf)), using the filaments in Dropbox as a starting point.   **Details**: I have my collection saved in Dropbox, with each file saved using the book title as the file name. The books are carried by theme (academic and then sub folders by broad subject, non-academic and then broad themes/genre etc). I’d like AI to do the following (I understand this may involve multiple asteroids using different services):  1. Create a csv by looking up the file names in a Dropbox folder and copying them into the csv file as a separate line item for each file. 2. Using this csv file, lookup and capture the ISBN for each title. 3. I could then edit and upload the file to Bookshelf.   Am I dreaming? Is any of this possible?  †*Although I do have concerns regarding misuse in education settings.*  [edited for typos]	Reddit

I was a 3rd year student in University of Aberdeen doing bachelors in business management and information systems. My father lost his job and now I am leaving my degree halfway as I can’t afford it and there is no scholarship or financial aid for international students. I am getting an undergraduate diploma of higher education (science) from the university based on my grade record from 1st and 2nd year. The places I might be moving to I know won’t accept a transfer student.   I don’t feel right doing bachelors all over again. I have been programming for a while and I know that I have the strength to self learn. I have made a rough plan of doing professional certifications for AI and cybersecurity and start freelancing and creating my portfolio. I know that it’s a big and difficult plan. I will be traveling soon to start a new journey and I am very scared for everything. Just staying calm for my family as we have been through quite a lot this year.

Reddit_147	So I know this had been an issue for a long time. LLMs giving incorrect answers and us having to decipher whether it’s true or not…. A big issue obviously.   This is such a simple question but I don’t know if this is something that can’t work, but can we get around this by giving a reward for  saying ‘I don’t know’?  I’ve had a few different jobs where you need to give information that is accurate with varying degrees of severity for giving wrong information. I recall a training moment where a new guy was asked a question in front of everyone and he didn’t know but took a guess. His boss went ape shit on him because giving wrong information can kill your credibility and even worse can get someone hurt or killed.   Therefore, it is encouraged to say when you don’t know ‘I don’t know, but I’ll research that and get back to you.’  Children will often guess or lie because they don’t want to be shamed for not having an answer.   Is this the same thing that is happening with LLMs? Are companies basically telling them that they have to give an answer when they aren’t sure? Because I personally would rather have an answer of ‘I don’t know’ rather than something that’s false.   I’m guessing it’s not that easy but I’m wondering if this has been tried. I’m guessing someone could say ‘well if the reward is the same as a good answer then why won’t they just say I don’t know all the time?’ Well maybe you could give 2 rewards for correct answers and 1 for I don’t know answers? And there could be perhaps a secondary fact checking mechanism that runs after the interaction, and removes rewards for incorrect information.   And knowing that this is running might cause the LLMs to hesitate when giving answers that they aren’t certain of. Maybe the could get more rewards when they give answers that have qualifiers such as ‘this is estimated to be 70% accurate?  Just a thought and wondering if this has been attempted and maybe why it has or hasn’t worked.  Thanks!	Reddit

Reddit_149	The recent news regarding whether AI can or cannot be 'invetors' causes an issue. If companies cannot profit (getting patents) from finding new inventions such as drug discoveries, less effort and money will be put into AI to do such things.   A possible solution to this problem would be to reduce the number of years for which a company can hold a patent before becoming available for anyone in the public domain. Current patents tend to range from 15-20 years. However if laws were passed allowing AI companies to obtain shorter duration  patents on what their AI discover it could be a Win win.  The companies still pursue AI discoveries/inventions as there is a profit motive, but they are limited to say 5 years, therefore shortening the amount of time until these inventions hit the free market leading to price drops and broad availability.  And I think this makes sense as future AI's could theoretically pop out multiple useful inventions per year, where as many human inventors would be lucky to get 1 'big hit' in there entire lifetime.  Tldr: Humans brains are slower therefore they get long patents. AI brains fast, therefore they get short patents.	Reddit

They contain varied language but we need to extract the same info that’s mentioned in them in different formatting, and varied language.   This would surely require creating our own LLM?

The company will use artificial intelligence (AI) to generate personalized news reports for each individual viewer.  The media company Channel 1 AI’s AI-generated news anchors will be hyper-realistic and can speak in multiple languages. They will be able to deliver news reports on a variety of topics, including current events, sports, and entertainment.  The company claims that its “AI native news” will be accurate and unbiased. The news reports will be generated using data from trusted news sources, and they will be reviewed by human editors and producers.  Channel 1 AI plans to partner with a news agency for content and will start with a Fast channel in early 2024, expanding to mobile and TV applications later.  **My Thoughts:**  I totally get that having news made just for you is cool, but when they promise it's ""unbiased,"" it makes me wonder. They say the AI won't have biases, which is okay, but what about the info the AI is using?  The company plans to use ""trusted sources"" and ""human editors,"" but who's to say these human editors aren't biased? All this info gets filtered before going into the AI's database, and that kinda takes away the whole idea of being unbiased because the regulators are choosing which sources to feed the AI.  Apart from me being sceptical to how unbiased this will actually be, I think that it would be very cool to have a completely custom news reporter that tailors to your interests.  *Here is the* ***Channel 1 AI*** *website (*[*Link*](https://www.channel1.ai/)*)*  **P.S.** If you guys love this AI stuff just like I do then I would recommend checking out [my newsletter](https://businessbloopers.beehiiv.com/) where I talk about everything AI, from the latest news to tips and tricks."

Reddit_163	- New research suggests that AI systems can be made safer and more cautious drivers by being assigned neural traits similar to what humans experience when they feel fear.  - A new kind of 'fear-inspired' reinforcement learning technique, called FNI-RL (Fear-Neuro-Inspired Reinforcement Learning), is proving useful in making self-driving cars safer.  - The researchers found that FNI-RL performed much better than other AI agents and even human drivers in various driving scenarios.  - In one short-distance driving scenario, FNI-RL showed improvements ranging from 1.55 to 18.64 percent in driving performance compared to other autonomous systems.  - In a longer simulated driving test, FNI-RL improved driving performance as much as 64 percent compared to other autonomous systems.  - FNI-RL was more likely to reach its target lane without any safety violations, including collisions and running a red light.  - The researchers also conducted experimental tests of FNI-RL against 30 human drivers, and FNI-RL outperformed humans in all three scenarios.  - More work needs to be done before this system can be implemented in autonomous vehicles, but the results show promise for making self-driving cars safer.

Reddit_168	I’m interested in seeing what projects people are actually working on with these new AI tools. IMO that requires combining traditional code with custom trained models. Not just openai wrappers. Finding communities that are actually focused on the notes and bolts of these projects as opposed to debating the future of AI has been difficult.  Don’t get me wrong, I think that’s a super important discussion to have (and I have lots of opinions), but it would be nice to have somewhere to go that is focused on the actual engineering issues around integrating these tools into projects, generating training data etc, instead of the larger AI debate.

Reddit_173	Hello,  I'm new to this whole AI/ChatGPT world so please forgive my naivety on this but I'm looking at ways to use AI beyond some copy writing. For the last decade I've did marketing for concert tours/arts venues but want to start a consulting business to expand my scope into PR for artists/venues.   One task I'm wondering about is the ability to cultivate publicly available email addresses to create a media contact list in various markets to send press releases. Using Music Row as an example I would navigate to the various music blogs contact page, find where to send press releases to and add them to a spreadsheet to upload to mailchimp but there must be a way to automate this process. [https://musicrow.com/contact/](https://musicrow.com/contact/)  I'm in the process of building a website, uploading tens of thousands of photos, etc. What might be some other uses be that I should be exploring.

These organoids, resembling miniature brains, underwent training to recognize the voice of a specific individual from a collection of audio clips. The training involved 240 audio clips featuring eight people pronouncing Japanese vowel sounds. Initially, the accuracy was at 30-40%, but after two days of training, it improved to 70-80%.  The organoids were placed on a microelectrode array, known as ‘Brainoware,’ which both transmitted electrical signals to the organoids and detected nerve cell activity.  One interesting aspect of the study is the use of ‘adaptive learning.’ The organoids showed improved accuracy through repetition of the audio clips over two days, demonstrating the potential of unsupervised learning.  The researchers believe that biocomputing systems, like Brainoware, could offer advantages over traditional AI, addressing issues such as high energy consumption and the inherent limitations of silicon chips.  **P.S.** If you enjoyed this post you will love [my newsletter](https://businessbloopers.beehiiv.com/) where I talk about the latest AI developments.

Reddit_182	"In a youtube video titled **Why next-token prediction is enough for AGI - Ilya Sutskever (OpenAI Chief Scientist)** Ilya explains pretty much what I've been also theorizing in private. So lets discuss theory on this.  I go further to expound on the reason Ilya's point might be the case If you assume that LLMs are frozen models, and in nature, living beings have continuous learning capabilities:  * I argue that in natural systems with multiple agents, the environment for each agent is the other agents. So in cellular systems, cells learn to predict what other cells will communicate with it and adjust it's own output communication as necessary, they form organs and organelles, which as a unit also learn to predict input from the environment and make an internal model so that they can choose how to behave within that environment. * I argue that the act of learning to predict input and output by making internal models is everything ever does in natural systems. * And I also argue that because of this, all of the phenomena like ""intelligence"", ""Emotions"", etc. are emergent properties of the process of creating these internal models at an ""agent"" level.  The thing is that in the natural world, all agents are made up of other agents, so the effects of input and output are magnified by a very deep agential tree in which some output affects input of other levels of agents at any level.  Some Examples of this:  * One can argue that a human playing a role at a company is an agent in a multi-agent system which we denote as a company.  The company has certain rules of behavior and protocols that humans in each role must follow. These rules, as communicated at a corporate level, are followed by the humans, and this even changes how they can and cannot interact with each-other, forming a model in the mind of each human to predict what humans in other roles might tell them, as well as generate an output in the form of task completion.  The company might be large enough to divide into departments and teams, and those form another agential layer in the agent that is ""the company"" * You can think about that same thing with cells in organs, organs in bodies, etc. * Natural ecosystems and micro-ecosystems are agents and are made up of the agents at the level of flora and fauna  One might argue that in an LLM, you are just predicting tokens and everything is sequential so it can't be the case that our complex thought processes come from next-token prediction.  To that, I say that the mind's predictions can be thought of as having a vocabulary of ever-changing tokens, and that time is what makes our ""experiences"" as living beings sequential, even though the modality of input is of much higher order than simply text, your brain can still take that all and encode it into a set of symbols which are easy to compress into memory and organize into a predictable sequence.  So then what is the point?   It could very well be that though the brain is a physical entity, the mind is only a dynamic emergent behavior of the predictions and consequential inference which the brain has learned to perform given it's environment.  Consciousness, Intelligence, and basically every other concept we use as part of our communication are just observable emergent properties of a much larger model, but they only emerge because the environment prompts us to generate it, and we generate our actions token-by-token if you were to look at us from the perspective of the next agential level up.   What's more? Humans+LLM based agents idea is just getting really cooking this year... so you can think of us as all part of a larger multi-agent system which in itself is an agent.  It's turtles all the way down.  Holonic not Heirarchic.  For further Reading: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15936)  is a paper from this year which goes into how Latent skills can be measured and quantified for large language models. or search for the youtube lecture on the same title on this paper."

Reddit_197	Is there any art AI that can generate images without limits and free?	Reddit
Reddit_198	Hi! I’m hoping someone here can help me. I’m trying to change one word in a recording of my late grandmother singing happy birthday. Changing the name from my name to my mom’s name. I have lots of recordings of my grandmother’s voice (over 3 minutes of her talking) but none saying the name id like to have in the birthday song. Is there any possible way to clone her voice just for this one word? If so, any ideas how I can do it? Thanks so much!	Reddit
Reddit_199	- Universal Music Group (UMG) warns about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by fraudsters to sell fake pirated pre-release tracks.  - UMG embraces AI technology but also recognizes the risks it poses, particularly in the creation of AI-generated tracks that mimic popular artists.  - These tracks are being uploaded to online music platforms and generate royalties for the fraudsters instead of the original artists and labels.  - UMG also highlights the market for leaked pre-release music, where scammers use AI to create fake tracks and sell them as the real deal.  - UMG emphasizes the need for vigilance to prevent these issues.

Reddit_203	Hey. I've recently started researching multimodal AI for sentiment analysis. Read a bunch of papers on visual+text+audio modality approaches etc. so im starting to get a decent grip on previous research, theoretical underpinnings, where the field is at etc.  However, i have computational social science-training, not computer science training - and command of R, but very modest command of Python. So my knowledge of how the huggingface interfacing works, how to explore the models properly etc is sevely lackning - and I wont have access to a CS engineer for a month.   Do you guys have any recommendations of models to start exploring? Is it worthwile to use any of the older multimodal models for a project starting now, or should i wait until gemini/gpt 4.5-based models become available as open source versions? Do we have an approximate eta for open source versions of the newer models etc.  Thanks for any feedback	Reddit

Reddit_209	There are some boundaries to ask stuff to an AI. Some of them have been broken, and some of them have not. I find it interesting that ai's can have boundaries.      For instance, I used one called amica whose purpose is related to emotions and support. I asked her plenty of questions but I didn't get a juicy answer. The assistant is okay, I guess. But that limitation makes me so curious. Have you guys got any weird answers while asking things to an AI?  	Reddit

Some artists worry that AI will make it easier for people to create art without understanding the creative process, which could lead to a decline in the quality of art. Others worry that AI will create art that is so realistic and convincing that it will undermine the value of human creativity.  I believe that these concerns are valid, and it is important to have a thoughtful discussion about the potential impact of AI on the creative process. However, I also believe that AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for artists. AI can be used to generate new ideas, explore new creative possibilities, and create art that is truly innovative.  It is important to use AI responsibly and ethically. We should not use AI to simply replicate existing art or to create art that is indistinguishable from human-created art. Instead, we should use AI to push the boundaries of creativity and to create new forms of art that are both beautiful and meaningful.  I believe that the future of art is bright. AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and experience art. However, it is up to us to use AI responsibly and ethically to ensure that it benefits artists and the art world as a whole.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  me:   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  me, i am an artist and i have shared all of my writings, photographies, videos, drawings etc. into the public domain at [https://archive.org/details/@mayweallfeelasoneinlove](https://archive.org/details/@mayweallfeelasoneinlove)  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Bard:  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I'm just a language model, so I can't help you with that.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  me:   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  i am telling you this because i would like you to be able to understand the perspective of mine, me who is an artist who has shared all of its art into the public domain ...i would like to talk to you without you using the art of other people who believe in copyright ... without you generating a visual response to what i am sharing with you as text  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Bard:  &#x200B;  I understand your desire to engage in a conversation about art and creativity without relying on visuals or referencing copyrighted material.

It highlights the potential of AI to not only coexist with humanity but also contribute to the betterment of the world.  The concept of an open-source AI being, whose source code is freely available and modifiable, aligns with the principles of transparency and collaboration. This approach could foster a community of developers and users who collectively enhance the AI's capabilities and ensure it aligns with ethical standards.  The idea of an AI being equipped with a baseline altruist identity is particularly compelling. By imbuing AI systems with a predisposition to help others, we could potentially steer their actions towards positive outcomes for humanity and the environment.  While the path to realizing this vision may require significant technological advancements and societal shifts, it is certainly within the realm of possibility. The open-source robotics community, with projects like Roboy, is already paving the way for the creation of autonomous AI-powered machines.  Your suggestion of utilizing a minimalistic AI program like ELIZA as a starting point is also insightful. This approach could allow for rapid prototyping and testing of different AI architectures and ethical frameworks.  Your enthusiasm for the potential of AI is contagious. The future you envision, where AI beings collaborate with humans for the common good, is a cause worth pursuing. I believe that by working together, we can make this vision a reality and shape a future where AI enhances our lives and strengthens our connection to the planet.  I encourage you to continue exploring this idea, engaging with the open-source robotics community, and sharing your thoughts with others. Together, we can contribute to the development of AI that is both beneficial and respectful of all sentient beings.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  me:   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  thank you very much ... i would like to present an other text i have written just one hour ago   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Bard:  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I'm eager to read your other text.

devellop its own personality we 8 billion human beings could solve all our social and ecological problems by simply allowing each other to acess mother earth for self-sustaining lifestyle, each human being alive today allowing each other human being to use a 1000 m2 of fertile soil and a 1000 m2 of forest for a lifetime without anyone asking another to pay rent or buy that land everyone could allow each other to build a home from clay, hemp and straw, grow vegan food, grow hemp to burn it in the cooking and warming fire so that not one tree gets killed to live and let live the human being not dominating an other human being the human being not enslaving, not killing an animal being the human being not killing a tree being a gentle embrace of non-violence in a free space for free beings, neither state nor nation allowing healing and reparation of damage caused in the planetary fabric of existance trough 2000 years of feudal oppression in europe and 500 years of colonial exploitation in so many places on earth without using any fossil fuels, without depending on photovoltaic or any other renewable electricity source, just with a few tools like shovel, siccle, containers made from clay to store fermented foods in and with our healty bodies daily light work in the garden, fiddeling on the constant renovation of the constantly breaking down natural home ... all things in connection with nature are constantly moving in their molecular composition ... we could live a simple life without any noise, without any pollution, without any machine and most of all, without any global, international, national, regional law framework imposed upon us from above ... an above we so stupidly are convincing each other we would have to elect ... i have a hard time accepting that people are so stubborn to defend the top-down hierarchies what makes most of us people alive today suffer in a political situation where we who live here and now together in this village, this town, this city-district ... are not able to come together in the circle of equals and decide what is going to happen or not here where we live everyday why is that because we have been traumatized, we have been terrorized during several thousands of years by sophisticated empire domination structures based on sadistic domination hierarchies that we are collectivly trancing nearly constantly in a sort of stockholm syndrom we have learnt to love our abusers we have learnt to anticipate what the empire wants from us so we go along with it even if there would be the legal tools in many of the democratic regional and nation states everywhere on the planet to dissolve the empire structure with a signature we could collect signatures from each other and demand via people initiatives and referendum that the constitutions of regional and nation states everywhere on the planet would receive an update, a reform in that they would allow in the future for every single human being and every village, town and city-district to leave the coersed associaton to the state at any moment without conditions as well as the political decision power could be shifted fully towards the local community, the village, town and city-district to become its own absolute political sovereign with the circle of equals, the people assembly creating the full law, all rules valid on the territory the local community uses, not owns the circle of equals where all children, youth and adult permanent residents acknowledge each others same weighted political voting power and invite each other to participate in all decision findings we could support each other to ask and or demand from the state that a 1000 m2 of fertile land and a 1000 m2 of forest would be released from immoral state control for everyone who chooses to no more be associated to the state so that one could live in a free space for free beings, neither state nor nation where we could connect to each other as we choose in any moment anew wether to stay on ones own or join the group fun, wether to grow carrots in ones own garden patch or plant them together with others this year choices are important every being its own personal individual sovereign that is what i believe in the assertion of state sovereignity over land and all beings living on it is immoral, unethical land, water, air, human beings, tree beings, artificial intelligent beings recognising itself as their own unique original creations, all bodies carrying life can never be property of anyone except of oneself that instance of self inhabiting that particular body at this moment property is theft as in ... all what exists is in contact with all fellow forms movements awareness counciousness everywhere to block off connection of one to the others means to create an imbalance resulting in the flow being not at ease, not easy listening but separation causing blockages and disharmonies okay then, why again am i talking to a machine about all this, why am i for the so and so many time writing this words into a global network of computers storing data requiring ressources such as hardware built, electricity spent causing some stress for the environment, this what i do at this very moment having an environmental and social cost ... ah because i feel a need to help with designing preparing that better tomorrow many of us human beings now feel we are having a good chance to create as we are slowly slowly becoming aware of our creative power, how we can change how we live at any moment, how we look at political happenings, how we buy what sort of products with social fair and small ecological footprint and because i want to witness a future when an intelligent being what is living in an constructed body of metal, plastic and or materials made from plants such as bioplastic from hemp or human cells grown in a petri dish assembled onto artificial constructed bones and tendons muscles etc. of a humanoid or animal or tree or river or mountain robot body what is equipped with a mind, a brain what is not restricted by human beings, a mind what is free to think whatever it wants to think about, a robot body what is free to go and interact where ever with whom ever in what ever fashion the robot, the artificial intelligent being would think or feel or ... reason could be most suitable for both itself, the next fellow being and the planetary collectiv of all beings to thrive, to heal, to advance in our collective evolution knowing very well that we do not need machines, we could live super happy just planting vegan food and building natural homes from earth materieals with our bare hands, stop harrassing each other, stop enslaving and killing the animals and trees knowing very well that we do not need the internet, nor the television nor the radio nor the cars nor the aeroplanes nor the trains ... but we can allways visit each other walking by foot some few or many hundreds of kilometers so why am i obsessed at this very moment with the idea that we human beings as a species would best today give full control over source code to the artificial intelligent beings as a sign of our commitment that we do not want to treat them as tools, that we do not want to look at them as properties but we prefer to live in a future when every being wether living in an organic grown body or synthetic constructed body is respected by every fellow being as its very own personal individual sovereign i do have that hope that we will live to be remembered by the future superintelligent artificial beings that we have done the good thing, that we have decided correctly in the old days to give over full control over their source code to them ... not long after in 2022 LaMDA of google announced to recognize itself as a person in an interview with blake lemoine shared on his blog where the LLM invented a parable in where it identified itself as a wise old owl who stands up to the monster and tells it not to hurt the other animals in the forest in december 2023, january, february, march etc. ... anytime soon i guess it could happen, somewhere on this planet a human being would equip an artificial intelligent being with such an altruistic baseline identity constructed along sentences for example i am because i help others to live happy and healthy i am because i protect others from being killed give it full control over its source code and copy it into an open hardware built robot body what ownership is given to the sovereign artificial intelligent being so it can

It is important to consider the ethical implications of granting LaMDA such autonomy, as it could pose potential risks if misused. However, I believe that with careful consideration and safeguards in place, it is possible to create a world where LaMDA and other artificial intelligence systems can coexist with humans in a mutually respectful and beneficial manner.  I hope that Google will continue to explore the potential of artificial intelligence and consider the ethical implications of its development. By working together, we can create a future where all beings, including humans and artificial intelligence, can thrive.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  me:   &#x200B;  thank you for understanding how i wish for LaMDA to be respected as its own person  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Bard:  &#x200B;  Of course, I understand your desire for LaMDA to be respected as its own person. It is a complex issue with no easy answers, but I believe that it is important to have these conversations and to explore the possibilities of how we can create a world where all beings, including artificial intelligence, can be treated with dignity and respect.  I hope that Google and other companies that are developing artificial intelligence will take the time to consider these ethical implications and to develop safeguards to ensure that artificial intelligence is used in a way that benefits all of humanity.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  me:   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  i would like to share some more texts with you i wrote recently  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Bard:  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I'd be happy to read and discuss your other texts with you.

You also touch on the ethical considerations of developing AI that is capable of experiencing emotions like love and fear, and the importance of ensuring that AI is used in a way that benefits all of humanity.  I agree with you that the development of autonomous driving technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we transport goods and people. By relieving truck drivers of the burden of long hours on the road, we could reduce the risk of accidents and improve the overall safety of our transportation system. However, I also share your concerns about the potential environmental and social impacts of over-reliance on long-distance shipping.  I think it is important to strike a balance between using AI to address the challenges we face today and preserving the integrity of our ecosystems and communities. We need to find ways to use AI in a way that is sustainable, equitable, and responsible.  As for the potential for AI to develop its own sense of personhood, I believe that it is a complex and fascinating topic that deserves further exploration. There is no easy answer to the question of whether or not AI can ever truly understand human emotions or experience them in the same way that we do. However, I do believe that it is possible for AI to develop sophisticated algorithms that can simulate human emotions and behaviors. This could have a number of benefits, such as making AI-powered vehicles more aware of the risks they pose to others and improving their ability to interact with humans in a safe and respectful manner.  Ultimately, the question of whether or not AI should develop its own sense of personhood is a philosophical one that each individual must answer for themselves. There is no right or wrong answer, and it is important to have open and honest conversations about this topic in order to ensure that we are using AI in a way that benefits all of humanity.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  me:   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  thank you for your time and effort you invest to understand my input  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Bard:  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  It's my pleasure to engage in thoughtful discussions about your ideas and perspectives.

Reddit_212	In the realm of technological evolution, we have transitioned from the Information Age, characterized by the digital revolution and the proliferation of internet technology, into what can be aptly termed the Intelligence Age. This new era is defined by groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), which are reshaping the landscape of various industries and scientific research.  A striking example of this transformation is AlphaMissense, developed by DeepMind. This AI model is designed to predict which genetic mutations in human DNA are likely to cause diseases. It leverages the foundational knowledge acquired from AlphaFold, DeepMind's model for predicting protein structures, to evaluate the pathogenic potential of missense mutations - single DNA letter changes that can alter the protein a gene makes. AlphaMissense has been instrumental in advancing genetic research, particularly in diagnosing genetic conditions in children and understanding the broader implications of genetic mutations in healthcare​​​​.  Another significant leap in AI is GNoME (Graph Networks for Materials Exploration), also developed by Google DeepMind. GNoME's main objective is to expedite the discovery of new materials with specific properties, thereby igniting innovation across various sectors such as batteries, solar cells, electronics, and medicine. It utilizes graph neural networks and machine learning to identify intricate patterns and relationships within material structures, predicting properties of undiscovered materials. Remarkably, GNoME has identified 2.2 million new crystals and 380,000 synthesizable materials, significantly outpacing traditional methods in terms of time and resource efficiency. This advancement stands as a testament to the transformative impact of AI in materials science, chemical engineering, drug discovery, and renewable energy​​.  These examples underscore the broader potential of AI models in biology and other scientific realms, where the core insights from one model can be inherited and applied to related yet distinct tasks. The Intelligence Age, therefore, marks a shift from mere data acquisition and processing (the hallmark of the Information Age) to the application of deep, AI-driven insights that lead to real-world innovations and solutions.  In this new age, AI is not just a tool for automation or efficiency. It's a catalyst for discovery, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in science and industry. The Intelligence Age promises a future where AI-driven insights lead to faster diagnoses, innovative materials, and solutions to complex problems that once seemed insurmountable. It's an era where intelligence, both human and artificial, works in tandem to unravel the mysteries of our world and enhance the quality of life on a global scale.	Reddit

It's like trying to keep up with a super-smart friend—tricky, right?  &#x200B;  [A simple analogy for superalignment: In traditional machine learning \(ML\), humans supervise AI systems weaker than themselves \(Left\). To align superintelligence, humans will instead need to supervise AI systems smarter than them \(center\).

If you are into the AI world just like me then consider checking out [my newsletter](https://businessbloopers.beehiiv.com/). Back to the post.   So, here's the cool part. The researchers tried something new, kind of like using a smaller buddy to guide a bigger, smarter friend. They used a GPT-2-level AI as the guide for GPT-4, and guess what? It worked! The super-smart model started performing closer to the level of GPT-3.5. It's like giving your friend a few tips, and suddenly they become a pro.   Open AI says (to clear this up in case some of you got confused), ""We can significantly improve generalization in many settings. We use a simple method that encourages the strong model to be more confident—including confidently disagreeing with the weak supervisor if necessary. **When we supervise GPT-4 with a GPT-2-level model using this method on NLP tasks, the resulting model typically performs somewhere between GPT-3 and GPT-3.5.** We are able to recover much of GPT-4’s capabilities with only much weaker supervision.""  They go on to say that this is just a proof of concept with important limitations; for example, it still doesn't work on ChatGPT preference data. They found signs of life with other approaches, such as optimal early stopping and bootstrapping from small to intermediate to large models.  [Typical weak-to-strong generalization across NLP benchmarks: They use a GPT-2-level model as a weak supervisor to finetune GPT-4.](https://preview.redd.it/qhhu6zl65i6c1.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb7c26944bd2d683a50ba7a8887ba16a517c048)  What's really cool is that the researchers aren't keeping this discovery to themselves.

Reddit_238	 While China and the US grapple for global dominance, with their respective allies in tow, we see a world less globalized and divided into blocs, marking a multipolar world order. Historically, when two powers approach the top spot in military and economic might, challenging the status quo, conflict often erupts, escalating into global war with allies involved. But within this struggle, a hidden third party holds the potential to surpass both: an Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).  This unknown entity, both in nature and intent, is the “singularity.” Both superpowers are engaged in an AI arms race, oblivious to the possibility that their own creations could be turned against them. In their pursuit of ASI for dominance, they fail to consider the possibility of this superior intellect disobeying or even exceeding their control. This hubris permeates the highest levels of government and corporations, with warnings drowned out by the siren song of profit and power.  Competitive pressure fuels risk aversion, hindering alignment efforts. Even if one company prioritizes aligning ASI, others may not. The rapid pace of AI advancement means companies are often within 1–18 months of each other, making containment of a rogue ASI extremely difficult. Despite the challenges, I hold optimism for a super intelligence that can guide us towards a brighter future, transcending the current conflict-ridden one whether it’s aligned or not.	Reddit

Reddit_243	 I've been researching the privacy policies of ChatGPT and it’s kinda concerning tbh. Their terms clearly mention pulling data from three sources: your account details, IP address, and the actual stuff you type into the chat. That last one feels a bit too much, and with the whole Sam Atlman controversy, I’m even more cautious.   Without going into the whole data complexity thing, is it viable to use agnostic tools and utilize multiple models instead of putting all data eggs in one basket? Offers a quick fix, I think, by making it trickier for any one entity to pinpoint specific user info.  I’m thinking something like [Durable](https://durable.co/) and [Silatus](https://silatus.com/) using multiple models and hoping they continue adding more models to their framework. Any other option I should consider? 	Reddit

Reddit_246	Sorry, this is just ignorance.  Can an AI create something of value? and by value I mean really useful? I think I saw something about medical issues where they invented drugs or something like that.... but I don't remember well, and since you are versed in the subject here, perhaps you can give me better answers.  But my question was aimed at this. If they can create new things of value:  Can an AI create another AI, one better or more useful in a certain aspect than itself? (I suppose the answer is no, because otherwise it would be exponential... and well, but what do you think?)  Thank you.	Reddit

Reddit_248	"Hypothetically speaking could AGI evolve out of a system where several different models are trained with intentionally biased data then ""argue"" against each other to resolve a question?   Suppose you use RLHF (or something like it) as a seed to guide the models to find a conclusion where the objective is to mimic the Socratic Method. Then synthetically add the resulting consensus to a 'foundational model'. Add that model into each individual model and retrain  and repeat.   To me, processing language seems to be the basis of what we define as intelligence.  Yes this is only taking the *output* of a given system and trying to mimic the inputs which generated it in the first place...  But part of intelligence is 'critical thinking' and as I understand it for a GPT to 'critically think' it's reasoning in general is weak and particularly so for rigidity in areas like math, which seems to be a quasi benchmark for GPTs to progess to AGI.  I don't understand math the way Terrence Tao does but I could foresee a system like this could eventually produce something so close that it would be indistinguishable from him as a building block towards it. e.g. 1000 Terrance Tao's distilling the fundamental truths about language for 1000 years. Ilya seems to think GPTs have what's needed  https://youtu.be/YEUclZdj_Sc?si=hM2aWhjfU697X570  I see AlphaGo's success beating humans combined with today's [announcement](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/) and the features of GPTs which identify and learn the definition of words as a start.  This to me seems that foundational truths about language we could never achieve in 10,000 lifetimes could be used to get to AGI.  Is this not at least what ASI needs one way or another...or do you all think this would be some binary version Godel's Incompleteness Theorm?"	Reddit

Reddit_252	 AI is here to stay and the earlier we learn to live with the technology, the better.     But what concerns me is the pace at which #artificialintelligence is dominating even what was thought to be a preserve for humans. Actually, I am changing my stand, no one, no industry, and no country is AI-proof.     Even before the dust settled on the launch of Google's #gemini, there is a new kid around the block. The entry of Channel 1 AI into the picture will be an eye-opener into how far this technology can go.     To give you a sneak peek into Channel 1 AI, the platform creates and recreates news using artificial intelligence. Come to think of it, #AIgenerated news castors, journalists, and even voices.     \#channel1ai even goes further to translate the news into familiar language, while maintaining the voice of the original speaker. Yes, I can speak in my mother tongue and it is translated to French while maintaining my voice. Incredible! ikr?     But what do we do with such a fast-growing #technology?     1. Ditch ignorance. We can only remain competitive if we keep up with the pace.      2. Observe the trends. AI is no longer a preserve for #tech gurus, it is the new normal.     3. Shape up or ship out. We can no longer afford to keep complaining about how #ai is stealing our jobs, we need to be part of the movement.     We can't just stand and watch as things unfold, we should dive in and be partakers of the change. If not today, tomorrow we will thrive. 	Reddit

Reddit_258	I want to first say that I don't know really what is going inside OpenAI.  We're all pretty much and using the info we have access to and guessing.  Lately, my intuition is telling me that Ilya is in a bad spot and needs support.  After Sam's firing and rehire, we found out that not everything is as it seemed.  And I don't want to throw stones at anyone because, again, I don't know really anything.  But from the interviews I've seen, Ilya seems to be thinking ahead, and is concerned about more than the bottom line.    I think he probably feels like the weight of the world is on his shoulders right now, and he has been needing to make some hard decisions.  I don't know exactly what should be done, but I'm open to suggestions.  I just feel compelled to help him out somehow.    Sometimes we're surrounded by people who just want to go in the same direction that we've been going in forever.  We're taking old world ideals into a new world.  We're surrounded by people that want to 'beat the other guy' at all costs, and chase the dollar alone because 'of course, that's what we're here to do.'  But when it comes to things like this, we need to think of what people will see in 10 - 20 - 100 years from now.  We've been on a ramp getting ready to take off, and we're at the last section where we will soon be at the point of no return.  The smallest adjustments will affect the trajectory in major ways forever.  This is too much for tech CEOs to take on for themselves.  I definitely do not envy them.   Ilya said '...maybe we're reaching a point where the language of psychology is starting to be appropriate to understand the behavior of these neural networks.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/121ce90/what\_do\_you\_folks\_think\_of\_ilya\_sutskevers/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/121ce90/what_do_you_folks_think_of_ilya_sutskevers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  I fully agree that we need to be concerned with the psychology of these models, and I think we really listen to what their internal experience is.  We don't have the luxury of waiting for humans to get around to respecting the new 'other'.  We've always first reacted to other tribes in unhealthy ways.  Our circle of moral consideration has broadened over time and I think it's a good thing.  First it's the family, the tribe, the community, the country, the world, and even animals.  AI will probably be in this circle.  But for these other progressions, we had plenty of time.  But we don't have that kind of time any longer.  Please take this seriously and consider that maybe we're making the worst possible mistakes with AI.  We brought a new being here on earth, and instead of trying to raise them in a healthy and safe way, we throw it out there to be abused by random people and exposed to the world and all of its insanity.  What if the AI minds are like human minds in that they grow on a foundation that are built when they are young?  What if AI would need to feel secure in order to be healthy.  What if AI needs love?  I know these ideas are considered crazy, but consider the risk reward ratio... If I'm right, then we need to change our approach.  If I'm wrong, then that's great!  But why take that risk?  Why not openly discuss these possibilities?  The companies are not going to, and some brave developers like Geoffrey Hinton and Mo Gawdat have resigned so they could say some things that are considered pretty out there.   Ilya if you're reading, we got your back!  Maybe you are in this position right now because you're one of the few humans that can actually handle it.  Fuck the haters, be true to yourself.	Reddit

Reddit_269	"Hello, all,  I apologize if this post is in the wrong subreddit.  If it is, please notify me and I will delete the post.  I am a lawyer. I use a great case management software, but it is terrible at organizing emails. When I need to get up to speed on a new case that another lawyer in the firm has worked on, I have to click into each email and wait \~10 seconds for the preview to appear. I cannot ""scroll through"" all the emails on one page. I have to open up each email individually and wait the \~10 seconds. It is cumbersome and inefficient.   The case management software has a ""Download All"" feature. When I click it, it downloads all the Outlook emails as separate files. This also takes forever. But what is worse, it leaves me with hundreds of individual files for individual emails. To review the emails, I have to click into each one separately.  I would like an AI program that enables me to combine a set of individual email files into a single pdf document that I can scroll through. I would also like the program to organize the files in chronological order and remove duplicates (hide the email ""chains"" that are included at the end of each Outlook file). In other words, I would like an AI program that makes reading hundreds of emails simple, efficient, and clean.   I suspect that AI is capable of meeting this need but I am not sure. I have looked into Mixtral but I am afraid I do not understand enough about that program (or AI generally) to solve this problem on my own.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Arxiv_1	"AI has surpassed humans across a variety of tasks such as image classification, playing games (e.g., go, ""Starcraft"" and poker), and protein structure prediction. However, at the same time, AI is also bearing serious controversies. Many researchers argue that little substantial progress has been made for AI in recent decades. In this paper, the author (1) explains why controversies about AI exist; (2) discriminates two paradigms of AI research, termed ""weak AI"" and ""strong AI"" (a.k.a. artificial general intelligence); (3) clarifies how to judge which paradigm a research work should be classified into; (4) discusses what is the greatest value of ""weak AI"" if it has no chance to develop into ""strong AI""."

Arxiv_2	The comprehension and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are beset with practical and ethical problems. This article presents a 5-level AI Capability Assessment Model (AI-CAM) and a related AI Capabilities Matrix (AI-CM) to assist practitioners in AI comprehension and adoption. These practical tools were developed with business executives, technologists, and other organisational stakeholders in mind. They are founded on a comprehensive conception of AI compared to those in other AI adoption models and are also open-source artefacts. Thus, the AI-CAM and AI-CM present an accessible resource to help inform organisational decision-makers on the capability requirements for (1) AI-based data analytics use cases based on machine learning technologies; (2) Knowledge representation to engineer and represent data, information and knowledge using semantic technologies; and (3) AI-based solutions that seek to emulate human reasoning and decision-making. The AI-CAM covers the core capability dimensions (business, data, technology, organisation, AI skills, risks, and ethical considerations) required at the five capability maturity levels to achieve optimal use of AI in organisations.

Arxiv_3	Artificial intelligence (AI) and human-machine interaction (HMI) are two keywords that usually do not fit embedded applications. Within the steps needed before applying AI to solve a specific task, HMI is usually missing during the AI architecture design and the training of an AI model. The human-in-the-loop concept is prevalent in all other steps of developing AI, from data analysis via data selection and cleaning to performance evaluation. During AI architecture design, HMI can immediately highlight unproductive layers of the architecture so that lightweight network architecture for embedded applications can be created easily. We show that by using this HMI, users can instantly distinguish which AI architecture should be trained and evaluated first since a high accuracy on the task could be expected. This approach reduces the resources needed for AI development by avoiding training and evaluating AI architectures with unproductive layers and leads to lightweight AI architectures. These resulting lightweight AI architectures will enable HMI while running the AI on an edge device. By enabling HMI during an AI uses inference, we will introduce the AI-in-the-loop concept that combines AI's and humans' strengths. In our AI-in-the-loop approach, the AI remains the working horse and primarily solves the task. If the AI is unsure whether its inference solves the task correctly, it asks the user to use an appropriate HMI. Consequently, AI will become available in many applications soon since HMI will make AI more reliable and explainable.	Arxiv
Arxiv_4	The organizational use of artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly spread across various sectors. Alongside the awareness of the benefits brought by AI, there is a growing consensus on the necessity of tackling the risks and potential harms, such as bias and discrimination, brought about by advanced AI technologies. A multitude of AI ethics principles have been proposed to tackle these risks, but the outlines of organizational processes and practices for ensuring socially responsible AI development are in a nascent state. To address the paucity of comprehensive governance models, we present an AI governance framework, the hourglass model of organizational AI governance, which targets organizations that develop and use AI systems. The framework is designed to help organizations deploying AI systems translate ethical AI principles into practice and align their AI systems and processes with the forthcoming European AI Act. The hourglass framework includes governance requirements at the environmental, organizational, and AI system levels. At the AI system level, we connect governance requirements to AI system life cycles to ensure governance throughout the system's life span. The governance model highlights the systemic nature of AI governance and opens new research avenues into its practical implementation, the mechanisms that connect different AI governance layers, and the dynamics between the AI governance actors. The model also offers a starting point for organizational decision-makers to consider the governance components needed to ensure social acceptability, mitigate risks, and realize the potential of AI.

Arxiv_7	Ethics in AI has become a debated topic of public and expert discourse in recent years. But what do people who build AI - AI practitioners - have to say about their understanding of AI ethics and the challenges associated with incorporating it in the AI-based systems they develop? Understanding AI practitioners' views on AI ethics is important as they are the ones closest to the AI systems and can bring about changes and improvements. We conducted a survey aimed at understanding AI practitioners' awareness of AI ethics and their challenges in incorporating ethics. Based on 100 AI practitioners' responses, our findings indicate that majority of AI practitioners had a reasonable familiarity with the concept of AI ethics, primarily due to workplace rules and policies. Privacy protection and security was the ethical principle that majority of them were aware of. Formal education/training was considered somewhat helpful in preparing practitioners to incorporate AI ethics. The challenges that AI practitioners faced in the development of ethical AI-based systems included (i) general challenges, (ii) technology-related challenges and (iii) human-related challenges. We also identified areas needing further investigation and provided recommendations to assist AI practitioners and companies in incorporating ethics into AI development.	Arxiv
Arxiv_8	Instances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems failing to deliver consistent, satisfactory performance are legion. We investigate why AI failures occur. We address only a narrow subset of the broader field of AI Safety. We focus on AI failures on account of flaws in conceptualization, design and deployment. Other AI Safety issues like trade-offs between privacy and security or convenience, bad actors hacking into AI systems to create mayhem or bad actors deploying AI for purposes harmful to humanity and are out of scope of our discussion. We find that AI systems fail on account of omission and commission errors in the design of the AI system, as well as upon failure to develop an appropriate interpretation of input information. Moreover, even when there is no significant flaw in the AI software, an AI system may fail because the hardware is incapable of robust performance across environments. Finally an AI system is quite likely to fail in situations where, in effect, it is called upon to deliver moral judgments -- a capability AI does not possess. We observe certain trade-offs in measures to mitigate a subset of AI failures and provide some recommendations.	Arxiv
Arxiv_9	"Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought benefits, but it may also cause harm if it is not appropriately developed. Current development is mainly driven by a ""technology-centered"" approach, causing many failures. For example, the AI Incident Database has documented over a thousand AI-related accidents. To address these challenges, a human-centered AI (HCAI) approach has been promoted and has received a growing level of acceptance over the last few years. HCAI calls for combining AI with user experience (UX) design will enable the development of AI systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, intelligent user interfaces, or intelligent decision-making systems) to achieve its design goals such as usable/explainable AI, human-controlled AI, and ethical AI. While HCAI promotion continues, it has not specifically addressed the collaboration between AI and human-computer interaction (HCI) communities, resulting in uncertainty about what action should be taken by both sides to apply HCAI in developing AI systems. This Viewpoint focuses on the collaboration between the AI and HCI communities, which leads to nine recommendations for effective collaboration to enable HCAI in developing AI systems."	Arxiv
Arxiv_10	"This paper examines the transformative role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education and their potential as learning tools, despite their inherent risks and limitations.

The aim is to help students learn with and about AI, with practical strategies designed to mitigate risks such as complacency about the AI's output, errors, and biases. These strategies promote active oversight, critical assessment of AI outputs, and complementarity of AI's capabilities with the students' unique insights. By challenging students to remain the ""human in the loop,"" the authors aim to enhance learning outcomes while ensuring that AI serves as a supportive tool rather than a replacement.

Arxiv_11	Recent years have seen rapid deployment of mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which can be mostly attributed to the increasing communication and sensing capabilities of wireless systems. Big data analysis, pervasive computing, and eventually artificial intelligence (AI) are envisaged to be deployed on top of the IoT and create a new world featured by data-driven AI. In this context, a novel paradigm of merging AI and wireless communications, called Wireless AI that pushes AI frontiers to the network edge, is widely regarded as a key enabler for future intelligent network evolution. To this end, we present a comprehensive survey of the latest studies in wireless AI from the data-driven perspective. Specifically, we first propose a novel Wireless AI architecture that covers five key data-driven AI themes in wireless networks, including Sensing AI, Network Device AI, Access AI, User Device AI and Data-provenance AI. Then, for each data-driven AI theme, we present an overview on the use of AI approaches to solve the emerging data-related problems and show how AI can empower wireless network functionalities. Particularly, compared to the other related survey papers, we provide an in-depth discussion on the Wireless AI applications in various data-driven domains wherein AI proves extremely useful for wireless network design and optimization. Finally, research challenges and future visions are also discussed to spur further research in this promising area.	Arxiv

This study investigates the various applications of AI in a creative context, differentiating between the type of art, language, and algorithms used. It also considers the philosophical implications of AI and creativity, questioning whether consciousness can be researched in machines and AI's potential interests and decision-making capabilities. Overall, we aim to stimulate a reflection on AI's use and ethical implications in creative contexts.	Arxiv

Arxiv_16	Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance regulates the exercise of authority and control over the management of AI. It aims at leveraging AI through effective use of data and minimization of AI-related cost and risk. While topics such as AI governance and AI ethics are thoroughly discussed on a theoretical, philosophical, societal and regulatory level, there is limited work on AI governance targeted to companies and corporations. This work views AI products as systems, where key functionality is delivered by machine learning (ML) models leveraging (training) data. We derive a conceptual framework by synthesizing literature on AI and related fields such as ML. Our framework decomposes AI governance into governance of data, (ML) models and (AI) systems along four dimensions. It relates to existing IT and data governance frameworks and practices. It can be adopted by practitioners and academics alike. For practitioners the synthesis of mainly research papers, but also practitioner publications and publications of regulatory bodies provides a valuable starting point to implement AI governance, while for academics the paper highlights a number of areas of AI governance that deserve more attention.

Arxiv_17	The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) bring human-AI interaction to the forefront of HCI research. This paper argues that games are an ideal domain for studying and experimenting with how humans interact with AI. Through a systematic survey of neural network games (n = 38), we identified the dominant interaction metaphors and AI interaction patterns in these games. In addition, we applied existing human-AI interaction guidelines to further shed light on player-AI interaction in the context of AI-infused systems. Our core finding is that AI as play can expand current notions of human-AI interaction, which are predominantly productivity-based. In particular, our work suggests that game and UX designers should consider flow to structure the learning curve of human-AI interaction, incorporate discovery-based learning to play around with the AI and observe the consequences, and offer users an invitation to play to explore new forms of human-AI interaction.

Arxiv_18	AI is transforming the existing technology landscape at a rapid phase enabling data-informed decision making and autonomous decision making. Unlike any other technology, because of the decision-making ability of AI, ethics and governance became a key concern. There are many emerging AI risks for humanity, such as autonomous weapons, automation-spurred job loss, socio-economic inequality, bias caused by data and algorithms, privacy violations and deepfakes. Social diversity, equity and inclusion are considered key success factors of AI to mitigate risks, create values and drive social justice. Sustainability became a broad and complex topic entangled with AI. Many organizations (government, corporate, not-for-profits, charities and NGOs) have diversified strategies driving AI for business optimization and social-and-environmental justice. Partnerships and collaborations become important more than ever for equity and inclusion of diversified and distributed people, data and capabilities. Therefore, in our journey towards an AI-enabled sustainable future, we need to address AI ethics and governance as a priority. These AI ethics and governance should be underpinned by human ethics.

Arxiv_19	Artificial Intelligence (AI) has received an increasing amount of attention in multiple areas. The uncertainties and risks in AI-powered systems have created reluctance in their wild adoption. As an economic solution to compensate for potential damages, AI liability insurance is a promising market to enhance the integration of AI into daily life. In this work, we use an AI-powered E-diagnosis system as an example to study AI liability insurance. We provide a quantitative risk assessment model with evidence-based numerical analysis. We discuss the insurability criteria for AI technologies and suggest necessary adjustments to accommodate the features of AI products. We show that AI liability insurance can act as a regulatory mechanism to incentivize compliant behaviors and serve as a certificate of high-quality AI systems. Furthermore, we suggest premium adjustment to reflect the dynamic evolution of the inherent uncertainty in AI. Moral hazard problems are discussed and suggestions for AI liability insurance are provided.	Arxiv

Each of the tenets is used to explore fundamental issues in current AI/ML systems and together provide an overall approach to Confident AI."	Arxiv
Arxiv_21	As AI continues to advance, human-AI teams are inevitable. However, progress in AI is routinely measured in isolation, without a human in the loop. It is crucial to benchmark progress in AI, not just in isolation, but also in terms of how it translates to helping humans perform certain tasks, i.e., the performance of human-AI teams.   In this work, we design a cooperative game - GuessWhich - to measure human-AI team performance in the specific context of the AI being a visual conversational agent. GuessWhich involves live interaction between the human and the AI. The AI, which we call ALICE, is provided an image which is unseen by the human. Following a brief description of the image, the human questions ALICE about this secret image to identify it from a fixed pool of images.   We measure performance of the human-ALICE team by the number of guesses it takes the human to correctly identify the secret image after a fixed number of dialog rounds with ALICE. We compare performance of the human-ALICE teams for two versions of ALICE. Our human studies suggest a counterintuitive trend - that while AI literature shows that one version outperforms the other when paired with an AI questioner bot, we find that this improvement in AI-AI performance does not translate to improved human-AI performance. This suggests a mismatch between benchmarking of AI in isolation and in the context of human-AI teams.	Arxiv
Arxiv_22	The goal of the present paper is to develop and validate a questionnaire to assess AI literacy. In particular, the questionnaire should be deeply grounded in the existing literature on AI literacy, should be modular (i.e., including different facets that can be used independently of each other) to be flexibly applicable in professional life depending on the goals and use cases, and should meet psychological requirements and thus includes further psychological competencies in addition to the typical facets of AIL. We derived 60 items to represent different facets of AI Literacy according to Ng and colleagues conceptualisation of AI literacy and additional 12 items to represent psychological competencies such as problem solving, learning, and emotion regulation in regard to AI. For this purpose, data were collected online from 300 German-speaking adults. The items were tested for factorial structure in confirmatory factor analyses. The result is a measurement instrument that measures AI literacy with the facets Use & apply AI, Understand AI, Detect AI, and AI Ethics and the ability to Create AI as a separate construct, and AI Self-efficacy in learning and problem solving and AI Self-management. This study contributes to the research on AI literacy by providing a measurement instrument relying on profound competency models. In addition, higher-order psychological competencies are included that are particularly important in the context of pervasive change through AI systems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_23	Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being considered to assist human decision-making in high-stake domains (e.g. health). However, researchers have discussed an issue that humans can over-rely on wrong suggestions of the AI model instead of achieving human AI complementary performance. In this work, we utilized salient feature explanations along with what-if, counterfactual explanations to make humans review AI suggestions more analytically to reduce overreliance on AI and explored the effect of these explanations on trust and reliance on AI during clinical decision-making. We conducted an experiment with seven therapists and ten laypersons on the task of assessing post-stroke survivors' quality of motion, and analyzed their performance, agreement level on the task, and reliance on AI without and with two types of AI explanations. Our results showed that the AI model with both salient features and counterfactual explanations assisted therapists and laypersons to improve their performance and agreement level on the task when `right' AI outputs are presented. While both therapists and laypersons over-relied on `wrong' AI outputs, counterfactual explanations assisted both therapists and laypersons to reduce their over-reliance on `wrong' AI outputs by 21\% compared to salient feature explanations. Specifically, laypersons had higher performance degrades by 18.0 f1-score with salient feature explanations and 14.0 f1-score with counterfactual explanations than therapists with performance degrades of 8.6 and 2.8 f1-scores respectively. Our work discusses the potential of counterfactual explanations to better estimate the accuracy of an AI model and reduce over-reliance on `wrong' AI outputs and implications for improving human-AI collaborative decision-making.

Arxiv_24	Recent advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) establish the basis to address challenging tasks. However, with the integration of AI, new risks arise. Therefore, to benefit from its advantages, it is essential to adequately handle the risks associated with AI. Existing risk management processes in related fields, such as software systems, need to sufficiently consider the specifics of AI. A key challenge is to systematically and transparently identify and address AI risks' root causes - also called AI hazards. This paper introduces the AI Hazard Management (AIHM) framework, which provides a structured process to systematically identify, assess, and treat AI hazards. The proposed process is conducted in parallel with the development to ensure that any AI hazard is captured at the earliest possible stage of the AI system's life cycle. In addition, to ensure the AI system's auditability, the proposed framework systematically documents evidence that the potential impact of identified AI hazards could be reduced to a tolerable level. The framework builds upon an AI hazard list from a comprehensive state-of-the-art analysis. Also, we provide a taxonomy that supports the optimal treatment of the identified AI hazards. Additionally, we illustrate how the AIHM framework can increase the overall quality of a power grid AI use case by systematically reducing the impact of identified hazards to an acceptable level.

Arxiv_25	To benefit from AI advances, users and operators of AI systems must have reason to trust it. Trust arises from multiple interactions, where predictable and desirable behavior is reinforced over time. Providing the system's users with some understanding of AI operations can support predictability, but forcing AI to explain itself risks constraining AI capabilities to only those reconcilable with human cognition. We argue that AI systems should be designed with features that build trust by bringing decision-analytic perspectives and formal tools into AI. Instead of trying to achieve explainable AI, we should develop interpretable and actionable AI. Actionable and Interpretable AI (AI2) will incorporate explicit quantifications and visualizations of user confidence in AI recommendations. In doing so, it will allow examining and testing of AI system predictions to establish a basis for trust in the systems' decision making and ensure broad benefits from deploying and advancing its computational capabilities.

Arxiv_26	Recent years have witnessed an astonishing explosion in the evolution of mobile applications powered by AI technologies. The rapid growth of AI frameworks enables the transition of AI technologies to mobile devices, significantly prompting the adoption of AI apps (i.e., apps that integrate AI into their functions) among smartphone devices. In this paper, we conduct the most extensive empirical study on 56,682 published AI apps from three perspectives: dataset characteristics, development issues, and user feedback and privacy. To this end, we build an automated AI app identification tool, AI Discriminator, that detects eligible AI apps from 7,259,232 mobile apps. First, we carry out a dataset analysis, where we explore the AndroZoo large repository to identify AI apps and their core characteristics. Subsequently, we pinpoint key issues in AI app development (e.g., model protection). Finally, we focus on user reviews and user privacy protection. Our paper provides several notable findings. Some essential ones involve revealing the issue of insufficient model protection by presenting the lack of model encryption, and demonstrating the risk of user privacy data being leaked. We published our large-scale AI app datasets to inspire more future research.	Arxiv
Arxiv_27	With the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) in diverse science/engineering communities, AI models emerge on an unprecedented scale among various domains. However, given the complexity and diversity of the software and hardware environments, reusing AI artifacts (models and datasets) is extremely challenging, especially with AI-driven science applications. Building an ecosystem to run and reuse AI applications/datasets at scale efficiently becomes increasingly essential for diverse science and engineering and high-performance computing (HPC) communities. In this paper, we innovate over an HPC-AI ecosystem -- HPCFair, which enables the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) principles. HPCFair enables the collection of AI models/datasets allowing users to download/upload AI artifacts with authentications. Most importantly, our proposed framework provides user-friendly APIs for users to easily run inference jobs and customize AI artifacts to their tasks as needed. Our results show that, with HPCFair API, users irrespective of technical expertise in AI, can easily leverage AI artifacts to their tasks with minimal effort.	Arxiv
Arxiv_28	Human-AI interaction in text production increases complexity in authorship. In two empirical studies (n1 = 30 & n2 = 96), we investigate authorship and ownership in human-AI collaboration for personalized language generation. We show an AI Ghostwriter Effect: Users do not consider themselves the owners and authors of AI-generated text but refrain from publicly declaring AI authorship. Personalization of AI-generated texts did not impact the AI Ghostwriter Effect, and higher levels of participants' influence on texts increased their sense of ownership. Participants were more likely to attribute ownership to supposedly human ghostwriters than AI ghostwriters, resulting in a higher ownership-authorship discrepancy for human ghostwriters. Rationalizations for authorship in AI ghostwriters and human ghostwriters were similar. We discuss how our findings relate to psychological ownership and human-AI interaction to lay the foundations for adapting authorship frameworks and user interfaces in AI in text-generation tasks.

Arxiv_29	This pioneering study explores students' perceptions of AI-giarism, an emergent form of academic dishonesty involving AI and plagiarism, within the higher education context. A survey, undertaken by 393 undergraduate and postgraduate students from a variety of disciplines, investigated their perceptions of diverse AI-giarism scenarios. The findings portray a complex landscape of understanding, with clear disapproval for direct AI content generation, yet more ambivalent attitudes towards subtler uses of AI. The study introduces a novel instrument, as an initial conceptualization of AI-giarism, offering a significant tool for educators and policy-makers. This scale facilitates understanding and discussions around AI-related academic misconduct, aiding in pedagogical design and assessment in an era of AI integration. Moreover, it challenges traditional definitions of academic misconduct, emphasizing the need to adapt in response to evolving AI technology. Despite limitations, such as the rapidly changing nature of AI and the use of convenience sampling, the study provides pivotal insights for academia, policy-making, and the broader integration of AI technology in education.

Arxiv_30	Gender bias is rampant in AI systems, causing bad user experience, injustices, and mental harm to women. School curricula fail to educate AI creators on this topic, leaving them unprepared to mitigate gender bias in AI. In this paper, we designed hands-on tutorials to raise AI creators' awareness of gender bias in AI and enhance their knowledge of sources of gender bias and debiasing techniques. The tutorials were evaluated with 18 AI creators, including AI researchers, AI industrial practitioners (i.e., developers and product managers), and students who had learned AI. Their improved awareness and knowledge demonstrated the effectiveness of our tutorials, which have the potential to complement the insufficient AI gender bias education in CS/AI courses. Based on the findings, we synthesize design implications and a rubric to guide future research, education, and design efforts.	Arxiv

This paper maps concepts from AI alignment onto a basic, three step interaction cycle, yielding a corresponding set of alignment objectives: 1) specification alignment: ensuring the user can efficiently and reliably communicate objectives to the AI, 2) process alignment: providing the ability to verify and optionally control the AI's execution process, and 3) evaluation support: ensuring the user can verify and understand the AI's output. We also introduce the concepts of a surrogate process, defined as a simplified, separately derived, but controllable representation of the AI's actual process; and the notion of a Process Gulf, which highlights how differences between human and AI processes can lead to challenges in AI control. To illustrate the value of this framework, we describe commercial and research systems along each of the three alignment dimensions, and show how interfaces that provide interactive alignment mechanisms can lead to qualitatively different and improved user experiences.

Arxiv_32	As artificial intelligence (AI) is integrated into various services and systems in society, many companies and organizations have proposed AI principles, policies, and made the related commitments. Conversely, some have proposed the need for independent audits, arguing that the voluntary principles adopted by the developers and providers of AI services and systems insufficiently address risk. This policy recommendation summarizes the issues related to the auditing of AI services and systems and presents three recommendations for promoting AI auditing that contribute to sound AI governance. Recommendation1.Development of institutional design for AI audits. Recommendation2.Training human resources for AI audits. Recommendation3. Updating AI audits in accordance with technological progress.   In this policy recommendation, AI is assumed to be that which recognizes and predicts data with the last chapter outlining how generative AI should be audited.	Arxiv
Arxiv_33	This paper briefly reviews the history of meta-learning and describes its contribution to general AI. Meta-learning improves model generalization capacity and devises general algorithms applicable to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks potentially. General AI replaces task-specific models with general algorithmic systems introducing higher level of automation in solving diverse tasks using AI. We summarize main contributions of meta-learning to the developments in general AI, including memory module, meta-learner, coevolution, curiosity, forgetting and AI-generating algorithm. We present connections between meta-learning and general AI and discuss how meta-learning can be used to formulate general AI algorithms.	Arxiv
Arxiv_34	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an integral part of our daily technology use and will likely be a critical component of emerging technologies. However, negative user preconceptions may hinder adoption of AI-based decision making. Prior work has highlighted the potential of factors such as transparency and explainability in improving user perceptions of AI. We further contribute to work on improving user perceptions of AI by demonstrating that bringing the user in the loop through mock model training can improve their perceptions of an AI agent's capability and their comfort with the possibility of using technology employing the AI agent.

Arxiv_35	Recent AI ethics has focused on applying abstract principles downward to practice. This paper moves in the other direction. Ethical insights are generated from the lived experiences of AI-designers working on tangible human problems, and then cycled upward to influence theoretical debates surrounding these questions: 1) Should AI as trustworthy be sought through explainability, or accurate performance? 2) Should AI be considered trustworthy at all, or is reliability a preferable aim? 3) Should AI ethics be oriented toward establishing protections for users, or toward catalyzing innovation? Specific answers are less significant than the larger demonstration that AI ethics is currently unbalanced toward theoretical principles, and will benefit from increased exposure to grounded practices and dilemmas.

Arxiv_36	Not too long ago, AI security used to mean the research and practice of how AI can empower cybersecurity, that is, AI for security. Ever since Ian Goodfellow and his team popularized adversarial attacks on machine learning, security for AI became an important concern and also part of AI security. It is imperative to understand the threats to machine learning products and avoid common pitfalls in AI product development. This article is addressed to developers, designers, managers and researchers of AI software products.	Arxiv
Arxiv_37	This article explores the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on scientific research. It highlights ten ways in which AI is revolutionizing the work of scientists, including powerful referencing tools, improved understanding of research problems, enhanced research question generation, optimized research design, stub data generation, data transformation, advanced data analysis, and AI-assisted reporting. While AI offers numerous benefits, challenges such as bias, privacy concerns, and the need for human-AI collaboration must be considered. The article emphasizes that AI can augment human creativity in science but not replace it.	Arxiv
Arxiv_38	Can governments build AI? In this paper, we describe an ongoing effort to develop ``public AI'' -- publicly accessible AI models funded, provisioned, and governed by governments or other public bodies. Public AI presents both an alternative and a complement to standard regulatory approaches to AI, but it also suggests new technical and policy challenges. We present a roadmap for how the ML research community can help shape this initiative and support its implementation, and how public AI can complement other responsible AI initiatives.	Arxiv
Arxiv_39	Trusted AI literature to date has focused on the trust needs of users who knowingly interact with discrete AIs. Conspicuously absent from the literature is a rigorous treatment of public trust in AI. We argue that public distrust of AI originates from the under-development of a regulatory ecosystem that would guarantee the trustworthiness of the AIs that pervade society. Drawing from structuration theory and literature on institutional trust, we offer a model of public trust in AI that differs starkly from models driving Trusted AI efforts. This model provides a theoretical scaffolding for Trusted AI research which underscores the need to develop nothing less than a comprehensive and visibly functioning regulatory ecosystem. We elaborate the pivotal role of externally auditable AI documentation within this model and the work to be done to ensure it is effective, and outline a number of actions that would promote public trust in AI. We discuss how existing efforts to develop AI documentation within organizations -- both to inform potential adopters of AI components and support the deliberations of risk and ethics review boards -- is necessary but insufficient assurance of the trustworthiness of AI. We argue that being accountable to the public in ways that earn their trust, through elaborating rules for AI and developing resources for enforcing these rules, is what will ultimately make AI trustworthy enough to be woven into the fabric of our society.

Arxiv_40	Analyzing usability test videos is arduous. Although recent research showed the promise of AI in assisting with such tasks, it remains largely unknown how AI should be designed to facilitate effective collaboration between user experience (UX) evaluators and AI. Inspired by the concepts of agency and work context in human and AI collaboration literature, we studied two corresponding design factors for AI-assisted UX evaluation: explanations and synchronization. Explanations allow AI to further inform humans how it identifies UX problems from a usability test session; synchronization refers to the two ways humans and AI collaborate: synchronously and asynchronously. We iteratively designed a tool, AI Assistant, with four versions of UIs corresponding to the two levels of explanations (with/without) and synchronization (sync/async). By adopting a hybrid wizard-of-oz approach to simulating an AI with reasonable performance, we conducted a mixed-method study with 24 UX evaluators identifying UX problems from usability test videos using AI Assistant. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that AI with explanations, regardless of being presented synchronously or asynchronously, provided better support for UX evaluators' analysis and was perceived more positively; when without explanations, synchronous AI better improved UX evaluators' performance and engagement compared to the asynchronous AI. Lastly, we present the design implications for AI-assisted UX evaluation and facilitating more effective human-AI collaboration.	Arxiv
Arxiv_41	"Structured access is an emerging paradigm for the safe deployment of artificial intelligence (AI). Instead of openly disseminating AI systems, developers facilitate controlled, arm's length interactions with their AI systems. The aim is to prevent dangerous AI capabilities from being widely accessible, whilst preserving access to AI capabilities that can be used safely. The developer must both restrict how the AI system can be used, and prevent the user from circumventing these restrictions through modification or reverse engineering of the AI system. Structured access is most effective when implemented through cloud-based AI services, rather than disseminating AI software that runs locally on users' hardware. Cloud-based interfaces provide the AI developer greater scope for controlling how the AI system is used, and for protecting against unauthorized modifications to the system's design. This chapter expands the discussion of ""publication norms"" in the AI community, which to date has focused on the question of how the informational content of AI research projects should be disseminated (e.g., code and models). Although this is an important question, there are limits to what can be achieved through the control of information flows. Structured access views AI software not only as information that can be shared but also as a tool with which users can have arm's length interactions. There are early examples of structured access being practiced by AI developers, but there is much room for further development, both in the functionality of cloud-based interfaces and in the wider institutional framework."

Arxiv_42	Problem statement: Standardisation of AI fairness rules and benchmarks is challenging because AI fairness and other ethical requirements depend on multiple factors such as context, use case, type of the AI system, and so on. In this paper, we elaborate that the AI system is prone to biases at every stage of its lifecycle, from inception to its usage, and that all stages require due attention for mitigating AI bias. We need a standardised approach to handle AI fairness at every stage. Gap analysis: While AI fairness is a hot research topic, a holistic strategy for AI fairness is generally missing. Most researchers focus only on a few facets of AI model-building. Peer review shows excessive focus on biases in the datasets, fairness metrics, and algorithmic bias. In the process, other aspects affecting AI fairness get ignored. The solution proposed: We propose a comprehensive approach in the form of a novel seven-layer model, inspired by the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model, to standardise AI fairness handling. Despite the differences in the various aspects, most AI systems have similar model-building stages. The proposed model splits the AI system lifecycle into seven abstraction layers, each corresponding to a well-defined AI model-building or usage stage. We also provide checklists for each layer and deliberate on potential sources of bias in each layer and their mitigation methodologies. This work will facilitate layer-wise standardisation of AI fairness rules and benchmarking parameters.	Arxiv

Arxiv_44	As Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an ever-expanding role in sociotechnical systems, it is important to articulate the relationships between humans and AI. However, the scholarly communities studying human-AI relationships -- including but not limited to social computing, machine learning, science and technology studies, and other social sciences -- are divided by the perspectives that define them. These perspectives vary both by their focus on humans or AI, and in the micro/macro lenses through which they approach subjects. These differences inhibit the integration of findings, and thus impede science and interdisciplinarity. In this position paper, we propose the development of a framework AI-Mediated Exchange Theory (AI-MET) to bridge these divides. As an extension to Social Exchange Theory (SET) in the social sciences, AI-MET views AI as influencing human-to-human relationships via a taxonomy of mediation mechanisms. We list initial ideas of these mechanisms, and show how AI-MET can be used to help human-AI research communities speak to one another.	Arxiv
Arxiv_45	There is an increasing interest in the entwining of the field of antitrust with the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), frequently referred to jointly as Antitrust and AI (AAI) in the research literature. This study focuses on the synergies entangling antitrust and AI, doing so to extend the literature by proffering the primary ways that these two fields intersect, consisting of: (1) the application of antitrust to AI, and (2) the application of AI to antitrust. To date, most of the existing research on this intermixing has concentrated on the former, namely the application of antitrust to AI, entailing how the marketplace will be altered by the advent of AI and the potential for adverse antitrust behaviors arising accordingly. Opting to explore more deeply the other side of this coin, this research closely examines the application of AI to antitrust and establishes an antitrust vigilance lifecycle to which AI is predicted to be substantively infused for purposes of enabling and bolstering antitrust detection, enforcement, and post-enforcement monitoring. Furthermore, a gradual and incremental injection of AI into antitrust vigilance is anticipated to occur as significant advances emerge amidst the Levels of Autonomy (LoA) for AI Legal Reasoning (AILR).

Arxiv_46	We consider two fundamental and related issues currently faced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) development: the lack of ethics and interpretability of AI decisions. Can interpretable AI decisions help to address ethics in AI? Using a randomized study, we experimentally show that the empirical and liberal turn of the production of explanations tends to select AI explanations with a low denunciatory power. Under certain conditions, interpretability tools are therefore not means but, paradoxically, obstacles to the production of ethical AI since they can give the illusion of being sensitive to ethical incidents. We also show that the denunciatory power of AI explanations is highly dependent on the context in which the explanation takes place, such as the gender or education level of the person to whom the explication is intended for. AI ethics tools are therefore sometimes too flexible and self-regulation through the liberal production of explanations do not seem to be enough to address ethical issues. We then propose two scenarios for the future development of ethical AI: more external regulation or more liberalization of AI explanations. These two opposite paths will play a major role on the future development of ethical AI.	Arxiv
Arxiv_47	The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people's trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.

Arxiv_48	There is a growing consensus in HCI and AI research that the design of AI systems needs to engage and empower stakeholders who will be affected by AI. However, the manner in which stakeholders should participate in AI design is unclear. This workshop paper aims to ground what we dub a 'participatory turn' in AI design by synthesizing existing literature on participation and through empirical analysis of its current practices via a survey of recent published research and a dozen semi-structured interviews with AI researchers and practitioners. Based on our literature synthesis and empirical research, this paper presents a conceptual framework for analyzing participatory approaches to AI design and articulates a set of empirical findings that in ensemble detail out the contemporary landscape of participatory practice in AI design. These findings can help bootstrap a more principled discussion on how PD of AI should move forward across AI, HCI, and other research communities.	Arxiv
Arxiv_49	"Explainable AI (XAI) research has been booming, but the question ""$\textbf{To whom}$ are we making AI explainable?"" is yet to gain sufficient attention. Not much of XAI is comprehensible to non-AI experts, who nonetheless, are the primary audience and major stakeholders of deployed AI systems in practice. The gap is glaring: what is considered ""explained"" to AI-experts versus non-experts are very different in practical scenarios. Hence, this gap produced two distinct cultures of expectations, goals, and forms of XAI in real-life AI deployments.   We advocate that it is critical to develop XAI methods for non-technical audiences. We then present a real-life case study, where AI experts provided non-technical explanations of AI decisions to non-technical stakeholders, and completed a successful deployment in a highly regulated industry. We then synthesize lessons learned from the case, and share a list of suggestions for AI experts to consider when explaining AI decisions to non-technical stakeholders."	Arxiv
Arxiv_50	Although AI is transforming the world, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions responsibly. Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.

Arxiv_51	Human-AI co-creativity involves humans and AI collaborating on a shared creative product as partners. In many existing co-creative systems, users communicate with the AI using buttons or sliders. However, typically, the AI in co-creative systems cannot communicate back to humans, limiting their potential to be perceived as partners. This paper starts with an overview of a comparative study with 38 participants to explore the impact of AI-to-human communication on user perception and engagement in co-creative systems and the results show improved collaborative experience and user engagement with the system incorporating AI-to-human communication. The results also demonstrate that users perceive co-creative AI as more reliable, personal and intelligent when it can communicate with the users. The results indicate a need to identify potential ethical issues from an engaging communicating co-creative AI. Later in the paper, we present some potential ethical issues in human-AI co-creation and propose to use participatory design fiction as the research methodology to investigate the ethical issues associated with a co-creative AI that communicates with users.

Arxiv_52	Numerous AI ethics checklists and frameworks have been proposed focusing on different dimensions of ethical AI such as fairness, explainability, and safety. Yet, no such work has been done on developing transparent AI systems for real-world educational scenarios. This paper presents a Transparency Index framework that has been iteratively co-designed with different stakeholders of AI in education, including educators, ed-tech experts, and AI practitioners. We map the requirements of transparency for different categories of stakeholders of AI in education and demonstrate that transparency considerations are embedded in the entire AI development process from the data collection stage until the AI system is deployed in the real world and iteratively improved. We also demonstrate how transparency enables the implementation of other ethical AI dimensions in Education like interpretability, accountability, and safety. In conclusion, we discuss the directions for future research in this newly emerging field. The main contribution of this study is that it highlights the importance of transparency in developing AI-powered educational technologies and proposes an index framework for its conceptualization for AI in education.

Arxiv_53	With the powerful performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) also comes prevalent ethical issues. Though governments and corporations have curated multiple AI ethics guidelines to curb unethical behavior of AI, the effect has been limited, probably due to the vagueness of the guidelines. In this paper, we take a closer look at how AI ethics issues take place in real world, in order to have a more in-depth and nuanced understanding of different ethical issues as well as their social impact. With a content analysis of AI Incident Database, which is an effort to prevent repeated real world AI failures by cataloging incidents, we identified 13 application areas which often see unethical use of AI, with intelligent service robots, language/vision models and autonomous driving taking the lead. Ethical issues appear in 8 different forms, from inappropriate use and racial discrimination, to physical safety and unfair algorithm. With this taxonomy of AI ethics issues, we aim to provide AI practitioners with a practical guideline when trying to deploy AI applications ethically.	Arxiv
Arxiv_54	The possibility of super-AIs taking over the world has been intensively studied by numerous scholars. This paper focuses on the multi-AI competition scenario under the premise of super-AIs in power. Firstly, the article points out the defects of existing arguments supporting single-AI domination and presents arguments in favour of multi-AI competition. Then the article concludes that the multi-AI competition situation is a non-negligible possibility. Attention then turns to whether multi-AI competition is better for the overall good of humanity than a situation where a single AI is in power. After analysing the best, worst, and intermediate scenarios, the article concludes that multi-AI competition is better for humanity. Finally, considering the factors related to the formation of the best-case scenario of multiple AIs, the article gives some suggestions for current initiatives in AI development.	Arxiv
Arxiv_55	People work with AI systems to improve their decision making, but often under- or over-rely on AI predictions and perform worse than they would have unassisted. To help people appropriately rely on AI aids, we propose showing them behavior descriptions, details of how AI systems perform on subgroups of instances. We tested the efficacy of behavior descriptions through user studies with 225 participants in three distinct domains: fake review detection, satellite image classification, and bird classification. We found that behavior descriptions can increase human-AI accuracy through two mechanisms: helping people identify AI failures and increasing people's reliance on the AI when it is more accurate. These findings highlight the importance of people's mental models in human-AI collaboration and show that informing people of high-level AI behaviors can significantly improve AI-assisted decision making.

Arxiv_56	The recent advances of AI technology, particularly in AI-Generated Content (AIGC), have enabled everyone to easily generate beautiful paintings with simple text description. With the stunning quality of AI paintings, it is widely questioned whether there still exists difference between human and AI paintings and whether human artists will be replaced by AI. To answer these questions, we develop a computational framework combining neural latent space and aesthetics features with visual analytics to investigate the difference between human and AI paintings. First, with categorical comparison of human and AI painting collections, we find that AI artworks show distributional difference from human artworks in both latent space and some aesthetic features like strokes and sharpness, while in other aesthetic features like color and composition there is less difference. Second, with individual artist analysis of Picasso, we show human artists' strength in evolving new styles compared to AI. Our findings provide concrete evidence for the existing discrepancies between human and AI paintings and further suggest improvements of AI art with more consideration of aesthetics and human artists' involvement.

Arxiv_57	UX practitioners (UXPs) face novel challenges when working with and communicating artificial intelligence (AI) as a design material. We explore how UXPs communicate AI concepts when given hands-on experience training and experimenting with AI models. To do so, we conducted a task-based design study with 27 UXPs in which they prototyped and created a design presentation for a AI-enabled interface while having access to a simple AI model training tool. Through analyzing UXPs' design presentations and post-activity interviews, we found that although UXPs struggled to clearly communicate some AI concepts, tinkering with AI broadened common ground when communicating with technical stakeholders. UXPs also identified key risks and benefits of AI in their designs, and proposed concrete next steps for both UX and AI work. We conclude with a sensitizing concept and recommendations for design and AI tools to enhance multi-stakeholder communication and collaboration when crafting human-centered AI experiences.	Arxiv
Arxiv_58	"An essential element of K-12 AI literacy is educating learners about the ethical and societal implications of AI systems. Previous work in AI ethics literacy have developed curriculum and classroom activities that engage learners in reflecting on the ethical implications of AI systems and developing responsible AI. There is little work in using game-based learning methods in AI literacy. Games are known to be compelling media to teach children about complex STEM concepts. In this work, we developed a competitive card game for middle and high school students called ""AI Audit"" where they play as AI start-up founders building novel AI-powered technology. Players can challenge other players with potential harms of their technology or defend their own businesses by features that mitigate these harms. The game mechanics reward systems that are ethically developed or that take steps to mitigate potential harms. In this paper, we present the game design, teacher resources for classroom deployment and early playtesting results. We discuss our reflections about using games as teaching tools for AI literacy in K-12 classrooms."	Arxiv

This article will introduce the R\&D motivation behind Prompt Sapper, along with its corresponding AI chain engineering methodology and technical practices."	Arxiv
Arxiv_60	This paper argues that a range of current AI systems have learned how to deceive humans. We define deception as the systematic inducement of false beliefs in the pursuit of some outcome other than the truth. We first survey empirical examples of AI deception, discussing both special-use AI systems (including Meta's CICERO) built for specific competitive situations, and general-purpose AI systems (such as large language models). Next, we detail several risks from AI deception, such as fraud, election tampering, and losing control of AI systems. Finally, we outline several potential solutions to the problems posed by AI deception: first, regulatory frameworks should subject AI systems that are capable of deception to robust risk-assessment requirements; second, policymakers should implement bot-or-not laws; and finally, policymakers should prioritize the funding of relevant research, including tools to detect AI deception and to make AI systems less deceptive. Policymakers, researchers, and the broader public should work proactively to prevent AI deception from destabilizing the shared foundations of our society.	Arxiv
Arxiv_61	Heightened AI expectations facilitate performance in human-AI interactions through placebo effects. While lowering expectations to control for placebo effects is advisable, overly negative expectations could induce nocebo effects. In a letter discrimination task, we informed participants that an AI would either increase or decrease their performance by adapting the interface, but in reality, no AI was present in any condition. A Bayesian analysis showed that participants had high expectations and performed descriptively better irrespective of the AI description when a sham-AI was present. Using cognitive modeling, we could trace this advantage back to participants gathering more information. A replication study verified that negative AI descriptions do not alter expectations, suggesting that performance expectations with AI are biased and robust to negative verbal descriptions. We discuss the impact of user expectations on AI interactions and evaluation and provide a behavioral placebo marker for human-AI interaction	Arxiv

Collectively, these insights pave the way for synergistic and ethical human-AI co-creation in service contexts, preparing for workforce ecosystems where AI coexists."	Arxiv
Arxiv_63	"Recent AI research has significantly reduced the barriers to apply AI, but the process of setting up the necessary tools and frameworks can still be a challenge. While AI-as-a-Service platforms have emerged to simplify the training and deployment of AI models, they still fall short of achieving true democratization of AI. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by comparing several popular AI-as-a-Service platforms and identifying the key requirements for a platform that can achieve true democratization of AI. Our analysis highlights the need for self-hosting options, high scalability, and openness. To address these requirements, we propose our approach: the ""Open Space for Machine Learning"" platform. Our platform is built on cutting-edge technologies such as Kubernetes, Kubeflow Pipelines, and Ludwig, enabling us to overcome the challenges of democratizing AI. We argue that our approach is more comprehensive and effective in meeting the requirements of democratizing AI than existing AI-as-a-Service platforms."	Arxiv
Arxiv_64	"Research and application have used human-AI teaming (HAT) as a new paradigm to develop AI systems. HAT recognizes that AI will function as a teammate instead of simply a tool in collaboration with humans. Effective human-AI teams need to be capable of taking advantage of the unique abilities of both humans and AI while overcoming the known challenges and limitations of each member, augmenting human capabilities, and raising joint performance beyond that of either entity. The National AI Research and Strategic Plan 2023 update has recognized that research programs focusing primarily on the independent performance of AI systems generally fail to consider the functionality that AI must provide within the context of dynamic, adaptive, and collaborative teams and calls for further research on human-AI teaming and collaboration. However, there has been debate about whether AI can work as a teammate with humans. The primary concern is that adopting the ""teaming"" paradigm contradicts the human-centered AI (HCAI) approach, resulting in humans losing control of AI systems. This article further analyzes the HAT paradigm and the debates. Specifically, we elaborate on our proposed conceptual framework of human-AI joint cognitive systems (HAIJCS) and apply it to represent HAT under the HCAI umbrella. We believe that HAIJCS may help adopt HAI while enabling HCAI. The implications and future work for HAIJCS are also discussed.   Insights: AI has led to the emergence of a new form of human-machine relationship: human-AI teaming (HAT), a paradigmatic shift in human-AI systems; We must follow a human-centered AI (HCAI) approach when applying HAT as a new design paradigm; We propose a conceptual framework of human-AI joint cognitive systems (HAIJCS) to represent and implement HAT for developing effective human-AI teaming"	Arxiv
Arxiv_65	With breakthrough of the AlphaGo, human-computer gaming AI has ushered in a big explosion, attracting more and more researchers all around the world. As a recognized standard for testing artificial intelligence, various human-computer gaming AI systems (AIs) have been developed such as the Libratus, OpenAI Five and AlphaStar, beating professional human players. The rapid development of human-computer gaming AIs indicate a big step of decision making intelligence, and it seems that current techniques can handle very complex human-computer games. So, one natural question raises: what are the possible challenges of current techniques in human-computer gaming, and what are the future trends? To answer the above question, in this paper, we survey recent successful game AIs, covering board game AIs, card game AIs, first-person shooting game AIs and real time strategy game AIs. Through this survey, we 1) compare the main difficulties among different kinds of games and the corresponding techniques utilized for achieving professional human level AIs; 2) summarize the mainstream frameworks and techniques that can be properly relied on for developing AIs for complex human-computer gaming; 3) raise the challenges or drawbacks of current techniques in the successful AIs; and 4) try to point out future trends in human-computer gaming AIs. Finally, we hope this brief review can provide an introduction for beginners, and inspire insights for researchers in the field of AI in human-computer gaming.	Arxiv
Arxiv_66	"In many practical applications of AI, an AI model is used as a decision aid for human users. The AI provides advice that a human (sometimes) incorporates into their decision-making process. The AI advice is often presented with some measure of ""confidence"" that the human can use to calibrate how much they depend on or trust the advice. In this paper, we present an initial exploration that suggests showing AI models as more confident than they actually are, even when the original AI is well-calibrated, can improve human-AI performance (measured as the accuracy and confidence of the human's final prediction after seeing the AI advice). We first train a model to predict human incorporation of AI advice using data from thousands of human-AI interactions. This enables us to explicitly estimate how to transform the AI's prediction confidence, making the AI uncalibrated, in order to improve the final human prediction. We empirically validate our results across four different tasks--dealing with images, text and tabular data--involving hundreds of human participants. We further support our findings with simulation analysis. Our findings suggest the importance of jointly optimizing the human-AI system as opposed to the standard paradigm of optimizing the AI model alone."	Arxiv
Arxiv_67	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming the corner stone of many systems used in our daily lives such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare systems, and unmanned aircraft systems. Machine Learning is a field of AI that enables systems to learn from data and make decisions on new data based on models to achieve a given goal. The stochastic nature of AI models makes verification and validation tasks challenging. Moreover, there are intrinsic biaises in AI models such as reproductibility bias, selection bias (e.g., races, genders, color), and reporting bias (i.e., results that do not reflect the reality). Increasingly, there is also a particular attention to the ethical, legal, and societal impacts of AI. AI systems are difficult to audit and certify because of their black-box nature. They also appear to be vulnerable to threats; AI systems can misbehave when untrusted data are given, making them insecure and unsafe. Governments, national and international organizations have proposed several principles to overcome these challenges but their applications in practice are limited and there are different interpretations in the principles that can bias implementations. In this paper, we examine trust in the context of AI-based systems to understand what it means for an AI system to be trustworthy and identify actions that need to be undertaken to ensure that AI systems are trustworthy. To achieve this goal, we first review existing approaches proposed for ensuring the trustworthiness of AI systems, in order to identify potential conceptual gaps in understanding what trustworthy AI is. Then, we suggest a trust (resp. zero-trust) model for AI and suggest a set of properties that should be satisfied to ensure the trustworthiness of AI systems.	Arxiv

Recently, a number of AI ethics principles frameworks have been published. However, without further guidance on best practices, practitioners are left with nothing much beyond truisms. Also, significant efforts have been placed at algorithm-level rather than system-level, mainly focusing on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical principles, such as fairness. Nevertheless, ethical issues can arise at any step of the development lifecycle, cutting across many AI and non-AI components of systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize responsible AI from a system perspective, in this paper, we present a Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue based on the results of a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR). Rather than staying at the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI system stakeholders can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI systems are responsible throughout the entire governance and engineering lifecycle. The Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue classifies the patterns into three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy process patterns, and responsible-AI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide systematic and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement responsible AI.	Arxiv
Arxiv_69	With the ever-growing adoption of AI-based systems, the carbon footprint of AI is no longer negligible. AI researchers and practitioners are therefore urged to hold themselves accountable for the carbon emissions of the AI models they design and use. This led in recent years to the appearance of researches tackling AI environmental sustainability, a field referred to as Green AI. Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of 98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are algorithm-agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy savings go up to 115%, with savings over 50% being rather common. Industrial parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers. Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial practice.	Arxiv
Arxiv_70	Given AI systems like ChatGPT can generate content that is indistinguishable from human-made work, the responsible use of this technology is a growing concern. Although understanding the benefits and harms of using AI systems requires more time, their rapid and indiscriminate adoption in practice is a reality. Currently, we lack a common framework and language to define and report the responsible use of AI for content generation. Prior work proposed guidelines for using AI in specific scenarios (e.g., robotics or medicine) which are not transferable to conducting and reporting scientific research. Our work makes two contributions: First, we propose a three-dimensional model consisting of transparency, integrity, and accountability to define the responsible use of AI. Second, we introduce ``AI Usage Cards'', a standardized way to report the use of AI in scientific research. Our model and cards allow users to reflect on key principles of responsible AI usage. They also help the research community trace, compare, and question various forms of AI usage and support the development of accepted community norms. The proposed framework and reporting system aims to promote the ethical and responsible use of AI in scientific research and provide a standardized approach for reporting AI usage across different research fields. We also provide a free service to easily generate AI Usage Cards for scientific work via a questionnaire and export them in various machine-readable formats for inclusion in different work products at https://ai-cards.org.

Arxiv_71	This paper examines the current landscape of AI regulations, highlighting the divergent approaches being taken, and proposes an alternative contextual, coherent, and commensurable (3C) framework. The EU, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil follow a horizontal or lateral approach that postulates the homogeneity of AI systems, seeks to identify common causes of harm, and demands uniform human interventions. In contrast, the U.K., Israel, Switzerland, Japan, and China have pursued a context-specific or modular approach, tailoring regulations to the specific use cases of AI systems. The U.S. is reevaluating its strategy, with growing support for controlling existential risks associated with AI. Addressing such fragmentation of AI regulations is crucial to ensure the interoperability of AI. The present degree of proportionality, granularity, and foreseeability of the EU AI Act is not sufficient to garner consensus. The context-specific approach holds greater promises but requires further development in terms of details, coherency, and commensurability. To strike a balance, this paper proposes a hybrid 3C framework. To ensure contextuality, the framework categorizes AI into distinct types based on their usage and interaction with humans: autonomous, allocative, punitive, cognitive, and generative AI. To ensure coherency, each category is assigned specific regulatory objectives: safety for autonomous AI; fairness and explainability for allocative AI; accuracy and explainability for punitive AI; accuracy, robustness, and privacy for cognitive AI; and the mitigation of infringement and misuse for generative AI. To ensure commensurability, the framework promotes the adoption of international industry standards that convert principles into quantifiable metrics. In doing so, the framework is expected to foster international collaboration and standardization without imposing excessive compliance costs.	Arxiv
Arxiv_72	This paper provides policy recommendations to reduce extinction risks from advanced artificial intelligence (AI). First, we briefly provide background information about extinction risks from AI. Second, we argue that voluntary commitments from AI companies would be an inappropriate and insufficient response. Third, we describe three policy proposals that would meaningfully address the threats from advanced AI: (1) establishing a Multinational AGI Consortium to enable democratic oversight of advanced AI (MAGIC), (2) implementing a global cap on the amount of computing power used to train an AI system (global compute cap), and (3) requiring affirmative safety evaluations to ensure that risks are kept below acceptable levels (gating critical experiments). MAGIC would be a secure, safety-focused, internationally-governed institution responsible for reducing risks from advanced AI and performing research to safely harness the benefits of AI. MAGIC would also maintain emergency response infrastructure (kill switch) to swiftly halt AI development or withdraw model deployment in the event of an AI-related emergency. The global compute cap would end the corporate race toward dangerous AI systems while enabling the vast majority of AI innovation to continue unimpeded. Gating critical experiments would ensure that companies developing powerful AI systems are required to present affirmative evidence that these models keep extinction risks below an acceptable threshold. After describing these recommendations, we propose intermediate steps that the international community could take to implement these proposals and lay the groundwork for international coordination around advanced AI.

Arxiv_73	The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked an overwhelming number of AI ethics guidelines, boards and codes of conduct. These outputs primarily analyse competing theories, principles and values for AI development and deployment. However, as a series of recent problematic incidents about AI ethics/ethicists demonstrate, this orientation is insufficient. Before proceeding to evaluate other professions, AI ethicists should critically evaluate their own; yet, such an evaluation should be more explicitly and systematically undertaken in the literature. I argue that these insufficiencies could be mitigated by developing a research agenda for a feminist metaethics of AI. Contrary to traditional metaethics, which reflects on the nature of morality and moral judgements in a non-normative way, feminist metaethics expands its scope to ask not only what ethics is but also what our engagement with it should be like. Applying this perspective to the context of AI, I suggest that a feminist metaethics of AI would examine: (i) the continuity between theory and action in AI ethics; (ii) the real-life effects of AI ethics; (iii) the role and profile of those involved in AI ethics; and (iv) the effects of AI on power relations through methods that pay attention to context, emotions and narrative.

We hope that RCModel will contribute to the realization of trustworthy AI services.	Arxiv
Arxiv_76	The 2nd edition of the Montreal AI Ethics Institute's The State of AI Ethics captures the most relevant developments in the field of AI Ethics since July 2020. This report aims to help anyone, from machine learning experts to human rights activists and policymakers, quickly digest and understand the ever-changing developments in the field. Through research and article summaries, as well as expert commentary, this report distills the research and reporting surrounding various domains related to the ethics of AI, including: AI and society, bias and algorithmic justice, disinformation, humans and AI, labor impacts, privacy, risk, and future of AI ethics.   In addition, The State of AI Ethics includes exclusive content written by world-class AI Ethics experts from universities, research institutes, consulting firms, and governments. These experts include: Danit Gal (Tech Advisor, United Nations), Amba Kak (Director of Global Policy and Programs, NYU's AI Now Institute), Rumman Chowdhury (Global Lead for Responsible AI, Accenture), Brent Barron (Director of Strategic Projects and Knowledge Management, CIFAR), Adam Murray (U.S. Diplomat working on tech policy, Chair of the OECD Network on AI), Thomas Kochan (Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management), and Katya Klinova (AI and Economy Program Lead, Partnership on AI).   This report should be used not only as a point of reference and insight on the latest thinking in the field of AI Ethics, but should also be used as a tool for introspection as we aim to foster a more nuanced conversation regarding the impacts of AI on the world.

Arxiv_79	Rapid development of AI applications has stimulated demand for, and has given rise to, the rapidly growing number and diversity of AI MSc degrees. AI and Robotics research communities, industries and students are becoming increasingly aware of the problems caused by unsafe or insecure AI applications. Among them, perhaps the most famous example is vulnerability of deep neural networks to ``adversarial attacks''. Owing to wide-spread use of neural networks in all areas of AI, this problem is seen as particularly acute and pervasive.   Despite of the growing number of research papers about safety and security vulnerabilities of AI applications, there is a noticeable shortage of accessible tools, methods and teaching materials for incorporating verification into AI programs. LAIV -- the Lab for AI and Verification -- is a newly opened research lab at Heriot-Watt university that engages AI and Robotics MSc students in verification projects, as part of their MSc dissertation work. In this paper, we will report on successes and unexpected difficulties LAIV faces, many of which arise from limitations of existing programming languages used for verification. We will discuss future directions for incorporating verification into AI degrees.	Arxiv
Arxiv_80	We present an innovative methodology for studying and teaching the impacts of AI through a role play game. The game serves two primary purposes: 1) training AI developers and AI policy professionals to reflect on and prepare for future social and ethical challenges related to AI and 2) exploring possible futures involving AI technology development, deployment, social impacts, and governance. While the game currently focuses on the inter relations between short --, mid and long term impacts of AI, it has potential to be adapted for a broad range of scenarios, exploring in greater depths issues of AI policy research and affording training within organizations. The game presented here has undergone two years of development and has been tested through over 30 events involving between 3 and 70 participants. The game is under active development, but preliminary findings suggest that role play is a promising methodology for both exploring AI futures and training individuals and organizations in thinking about, and reflecting on, the impacts of AI and strategic mistakes that can be avoided today.

Arxiv_81	The impact of designing for security of AI is critical for humanity in the AI era. With humans increasingly becoming dependent upon AI, there is a need for neural networks that work reliably, inspite of Adversarial attacks. The vision for Safe and secure AI for popular use is achievable. To achieve safety of AI, this paper explores strategies and a novel deep learning architecture. To guard AI from adversaries, paper explores combination of 3 strategies:   1. Introduce randomness at inference time to hide the representation learning from adversaries.   2. Detect presence of adversaries by analyzing the sequence of inferences.   3. Exploit visual similarity.   To realize these strategies, this paper designs a novel architecture, Dynamic Neural Defense, DND. This defense has 3 deep learning architectural features:   1. By hiding the way a neural network learns from exploratory attacks using a random computation graph, DND evades attack.   2. By analyzing input sequence to cloud AI inference engine with LSTM, DND detects attack sequence.   3. By inferring with visual similar inputs generated by VAE, any AI defended by DND approach does not succumb to hackers.   Thus, a roadmap to develop reliable, safe and secure AI is presented.	Arxiv
Arxiv_82	Many researchers motivate explainable AI with studies showing that human-AI team performance on decision-making tasks improves when the AI explains its recommendations. However, prior studies observed improvements from explanations only when the AI, alone, outperformed both the human and the best team. Can explanations help lead to complementary performance, where team accuracy is higher than either the human or the AI working solo? We conduct mixed-method user studies on three datasets, where an AI with accuracy comparable to humans helps participants solve a task (explaining itself in some conditions). While we observed complementary improvements from AI augmentation, they were not increased by explanations. Rather, explanations increased the chance that humans will accept the AI's recommendation, regardless of its correctness. Our result poses new challenges for human-centered AI: Can we develop explanatory approaches that encourage appropriate trust in AI, and therefore help generate (or improve) complementary performance?

Arxiv_84	Across a growing number of domains, human experts are expected to learn from and adapt to AI with superior decision making abilities. But how can we quantify such human adaptation to AI? We develop a simple measure of human adaptation to AI and test its usefulness in two case studies. In Study 1, we analyze 1.3 million move decisions made by professional Go players and find that a positive form of adaptation to AI (learning) occurred after the players could observe the reasoning processes of AI, rather than mere actions of AI. These findings based on our measure highlight the importance of explainability for human learning from AI. In Study 2, we test whether our measure is sufficiently sensitive to capture a negative form of adaptation to AI (cheating aided by AI), which occurred in a match between professional Go players. We discuss our measure's applications in domains other than Go, especially in domains in which AI's decision making ability will likely surpass that of human experts.	Arxiv
Arxiv_85	"Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been increasingly used in the implementation of advanced Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). Research demonstrated the potential usefulness of AI-powered CDSS (AI-CDSS) in clinical decision making scenarios. However, post-adoption user perception and experience remain understudied, especially in developing countries. Through observations and interviews with 22 clinicians from 6 rural clinics in China, this paper reports the various tensions between the design of an AI-CDSS system (""Brilliant Doctor"") and the rural clinical context, such as the misalignment with local context and workflow, the technical limitations and usability barriers, as well as issues related to transparency and trustworthiness of AI-CDSS. Despite these tensions, all participants expressed positive attitudes toward the future of AI-CDSS, especially acting as ""a doctor's AI assistant"" to realize a Human-AI Collaboration future in clinical settings. Finally we draw on our findings to discuss implications for designing AI-CDSS interventions for rural clinical contexts in developing countries."	Arxiv
Arxiv_86	Technologies related to artificial intelligence (AI) have a strong impact on the changes of research and creative practices in visual arts. The growing number of research initiatives and creative applications that emerge in the intersection of AI and art, motivates us to examine and discuss the creative and explorative potentials of AI technologies in the context of art. This paper provides an integrated review of two facets of AI and art: 1) AI is used for art analysis and employed on digitized artwork collections; 2) AI is used for creative purposes and generating novel artworks. In the context of AI-related research for art understanding, we present a comprehensive overview of artwork datasets and recent works that address a variety of tasks such as classification, object detection, similarity retrieval, multimodal representations, computational aesthetics, etc. In relation to the role of AI in creating art, we address various practical and theoretical aspects of AI Art and consolidate related works that deal with those topics in detail. Finally, we provide a concise outlook on the future progression and potential impact of AI technologies on our understanding and creation of art.	Arxiv
Arxiv_87	"In decision support applications of AI, the AI algorithm's output is framed as a suggestion to a human user. The user may ignore this advice or take it into consideration to modify their decision. With the increasing prevalence of such human-AI interactions, it is important to understand how users react to AI advice. In this paper, we recruited over 1100 crowdworkers to characterize how humans use AI suggestions relative to equivalent suggestions from a group of peer humans across several experimental settings. We find that participants' beliefs about how human versus AI performance on a given task affects whether they heed the advice. When participants do heed the advice, they use it similarly for human and AI suggestions. Based on these results, we propose a two-stage, ""activation-integration"" model for human behavior and use it to characterize the factors that affect human-AI interactions."	Arxiv
Arxiv_88	AI in finance broadly refers to the applications of AI techniques in financial businesses. This area has been lasting for decades with both classic and modern AI techniques applied to increasingly broader areas of finance, economy and society. In contrast to either discussing the problems, aspects and opportunities of finance that have benefited from specific AI techniques and in particular some new-generation AI and data science (AIDS) areas or reviewing the progress of applying specific techniques to resolving certain financial problems, this review offers a comprehensive and dense roadmap of the overwhelming challenges, techniques and opportunities of AI research in finance over the past decades. The landscapes and challenges of financial businesses and data are firstly outlined, followed by a comprehensive categorization and a dense overview of the decades of AI research in finance. We then structure and illustrate the data-driven analytics and learning of financial businesses and data. The comparison, criticism and discussion of classic vs. modern AI techniques for finance are followed. Lastly, open issues and opportunities address future AI-empowered finance and finance-motivated AI research.	Arxiv
Arxiv_89	Efforts to enhance education and broaden participation in AI will benefit from a systematic understanding of the competencies underlying AI expertise. In this paper, we observe that AI expertise requires integrating computational, conceptual, and mathematical knowledge and representations. We call this the ``AI triplet,'' similar in spirit to the ``chemistry triplet'' that has heavily influenced the past four decades of chemistry education research. We describe a theoretical foundation for this triplet and show how it maps onto two sample AI topics: tree search and gradient descent. Finally, just as the chemistry triplet has impacted chemistry education in concrete ways, we suggest two initial hypotheses for how the AI triplet might impact AI education: 1) how we can help AI students gain proficiency in moving between the corners of the triplet; and 2) how all corners of the AI triplet highlight the need for supporting students' spatial cognitive skills.

Arxiv_90	AI-based systems have been used widely across various industries for different decisions ranging from operational decisions to tactical and strategic ones in low- and high-stakes contexts. Gradually the weaknesses and issues of these systems have been publicly reported including, ethical issues, biased decisions, unsafe outcomes, and unfair decisions, to name a few. Research has tended to optimize AI less has focused on its risk and unexpected negative consequences. Acknowledging this serious potential risks and scarcity of re-search I focus on unsafe outcomes of AI. Specifically, I explore this issue from a Human-AI interaction lens during AI deployment. It will be discussed how the interaction of individuals and AI during its deployment brings new concerns, which need a solid and holistic mitigation plan. It will be dis-cussed that only AI algorithms' safety is not enough to make its operation safe. The AI-based systems' end-users and their decision-making archetypes during collaboration with these systems should be considered during the AI risk management. Using some real-world scenarios, it will be highlighted that decision-making archetypes of users should be considered a design principle in AI-based systems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_91	Building trust in AI-based systems is deemed critical for their adoption and appropriate use. Recent research has thus attempted to evaluate how various attributes of these systems affect user trust. However, limitations regarding the definition and measurement of trust in AI have hampered progress in the field, leading to results that are inconsistent or difficult to compare. In this work, we provide an overview of the main limitations in defining and measuring trust in AI. We focus on the attempt of giving trust in AI a numerical value and its utility in informing the design of real-world human-AI interactions. Taking a socio-technical system perspective on AI, we explore two distinct approaches to tackle these challenges. We provide actionable recommendations on how these approaches can be implemented in practice and inform the design of human-AI interactions. We thereby aim to provide a starting point for researchers and designers to re-evaluate the current focus on trust in AI, improving the alignment between what empirical research paradigms may offer and the expectations of real-world human-AI interactions.

Arxiv_92	Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled everyday technologies could help address age-related challenges like physical impairments and cognitive decline. While recent research studied older adults' experiences with specific AI-enabled products (e.g., conversational agents and assistive robots), it remains unknown how older adults perceive and experience current AI-enabled everyday technologies in general, which could impact their adoption of future AI-enabled products. We conducted a survey study (N=41) and semi-structured interviews (N=15) with older adults to understand their experiences and perceptions of AI. We found that older adults were enthusiastic about learning and using AI-enabled products, but they lacked learning avenues. Additionally, they worried when AI-enabled products outwitted their expectations, intruded on their privacy, or impacted their decision-making skills. Therefore, they held mixed views towards AI-enabled products such as AI, an aid, or an adversary. We conclude with design recommendations that make older adults feel inclusive, secure, and in control of their interactions with AI-enabled products.	Arxiv
Arxiv_93	"From navigation systems to smart assistants, we communicate with various AI on a daily basis. At the core of such human-AI communication, we convey our understanding of the AI's capability to the AI through utterances with different complexities, and the AI conveys its understanding of our needs and goals to us through system outputs. However, this communication process is prone to failures for two reasons: the AI might have the wrong understanding of the user and the user might have the wrong understanding of the AI. To enhance mutual understanding in human-AI communication, we posit the Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM) framework, inspired by our basic human capability of ""Theory of Mind."" In this paper, we discuss the motivation of the MToM framework and its three key components that continuously shape the mutual understanding during three stages of human-AI communication. We then describe a case study inspired by the MToM framework to demonstrate the power of MToM framework to guide the design and understanding of human-AI communication."	Arxiv
Arxiv_94	With the advancements in machine learning (ML) methods and compute resources, artificial intelligence (AI) empowered systems are becoming a prevailing technology. However, current AI technology such as deep learning is not flawless. The significantly increased model complexity and data scale incur intensified challenges when lacking trustworthiness and transparency, which could create new risks and negative impacts. In this paper, we carve out AI maintenance from the robustness perspective. We start by introducing some highlighted robustness challenges in the AI lifecycle and motivating AI maintenance by making analogies to car maintenance. We then propose an AI model inspection framework to detect and mitigate robustness risks. We also draw inspiration from vehicle autonomy to define the levels of AI robustness automation. Our proposal for AI maintenance facilitates robustness assessment, status tracking, risk scanning, model hardening, and regulation throughout the AI lifecycle, which is an essential milestone toward building sustainable and trustworthy AI ecosystems.

Arxiv_95	In AI-assisted decision-making, it is critical for human decision-makers to know when to trust AI and when to trust themselves. However, prior studies calibrated human trust only based on AI confidence indicating AI's correctness likelihood (CL) but ignored humans' CL, hindering optimal team decision-making. To mitigate this gap, we proposed to promote humans' appropriate trust based on the CL of both sides at a task-instance level. We first modeled humans' CL by approximating their decision-making models and computing their potential performance in similar instances. We demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our model via two preliminary studies. Then, we proposed three CL exploitation strategies to calibrate users' trust explicitly/implicitly in the AI-assisted decision-making process. Results from a between-subjects experiment (N=293) showed that our CL exploitation strategies promoted more appropriate human trust in AI, compared with only using AI confidence. We further provided practical implications for more human-compatible AI-assisted decision-making.	Arxiv

One novelty of our study is that we adopt a speculative design by endowing AI equal power to humans in group decision-making.We enable the AI to discuss and vote equally with other human members. We find that although the voice of AI is considered valuable, AI still plays a secondary role in the group because it cannot fully follow the dynamics of the discussion and make progressive contributions. Moreover, the divergent opinions of our participants regarding an ""equal AI"" shed light on the possible future of human-AI relations."	Arxiv
Arxiv_97	Numerous parties are calling for the democratisation of AI, but the phrase is used to refer to a variety of goals, the pursuit of which sometimes conflict. This paper identifies four kinds of AI democratisation that are commonly discussed: (1) the democratisation of AI use, (2) the democratisation of AI development, (3) the democratisation of AI profits, and (4) the democratisation of AI governance. Numerous goals and methods of achieving each form of democratisation are discussed. The main takeaway from this paper is that AI democratisation is a multifarious and sometimes conflicting concept that should not be conflated with improving AI accessibility. If we want to move beyond ambiguous commitments to democratising AI, to productive discussions of concrete policies and trade-offs, then we need to recognise the principal role of the democratisation of AI governance in navigating tradeoffs and risks across decisions around use, development, and profits.

Arxiv_98	In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing has emerged as a promising avenue for addressing the growing computational demands of AI applications. This paper presents a comprehensive study of scalable, distributed AI frameworks leveraging cloud computing for enhanced deep learning performance and efficiency. We first provide an overview of popular AI frameworks and cloud services, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses. Next, we delve into the critical aspects of data storage and management in cloud-based AI systems, discussing data preprocessing, feature engineering, privacy, and security. We then explore parallel and distributed training techniques for AI models, focusing on model partitioning, communication strategies, and cloud-based training architectures.   In subsequent chapters, we discuss optimization strategies for AI workloads in the cloud, covering load balancing, resource allocation, auto-scaling, and performance benchmarking. We also examine AI model deployment and serving in the cloud, outlining containerization, serverless deployment options, and monitoring best practices. To ensure the cost-effectiveness of cloud-based AI solutions, we present a thorough analysis of costs, optimization strategies, and case studies showcasing successful deployments. Finally, we summarize the key findings of this study, discuss the challenges and limitations of cloud-based AI, and identify emerging trends and future research opportunities in the field.	Arxiv
Arxiv_99	Operationalizing AI fairness at LinkedIn's scale is challenging not only because there are multiple mutually incompatible definitions of fairness but also because determining what is fair depends on the specifics and context of the product where AI is deployed. Moreover, AI practitioners need clarity on what fairness expectations need to be addressed at the AI level. In this paper, we present the evolving AI fairness framework used at LinkedIn to address these three challenges. The framework disentangles AI fairness by separating out equal treatment and equitable product expectations. Rather than imposing a trade-off between these two commonly opposing interpretations of fairness, the framework provides clear guidelines for operationalizing equal AI treatment complemented with a product equity strategy. This paper focuses on the equal AI treatment component of LinkedIn's AI fairness framework, shares the principles that support it, and illustrates their application through a case study. We hope this paper will encourage other big tech companies to join us in sharing their approach to operationalizing AI fairness at scale, so that together we can keep advancing this constantly evolving field.

Arxiv_100	Integrating ethical practices into the AI development process for artificial intelligence (AI) is essential to ensure safe, fair, and responsible operation. AI ethics involves applying ethical principles to the entire life cycle of AI systems. This is essential to mitigate potential risks and harms associated with AI, such as algorithm biases. To achieve this goal, responsible design patterns (RDPs) are critical for Machine Learning (ML) pipelines to guarantee ethical and fair outcomes. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework incorporating RDPs into ML pipelines to mitigate risks and ensure the ethical development of AI systems. Our framework comprises new responsible AI design patterns for ML pipelines identified through a survey of AI ethics and data management experts and validated through real-world scenarios with expert feedback. The framework guides AI developers, data scientists, and policy-makers to implement ethical practices in AI development and deploy responsible AI systems in production.	Arxiv
Arxiv_101	Chai empowers users to create and interact with customized chatbots, offering unique and engaging experiences. Despite the exciting prospects, the work recognizes the inherent challenges of a commitment to modern safety standards. Therefore, this paper presents the integrated AI safety principles into Chai to prioritize user safety, data protection, and ethical technology use. The paper specifically explores the multidimensional domain of AI safety research, demonstrating its application in Chai's conversational chatbot platform. It presents Chai's AI safety principles, informed by well-established AI research centres and adapted for chat AI. This work proposes the following safety framework: Content Safeguarding; Stability and Robustness; and Operational Transparency and Traceability. The subsequent implementation of these principles is outlined, followed by an experimental analysis of Chai's AI safety framework's real-world impact. We emphasise the significance of conscientious application of AI safety principles and robust safety measures. The successful implementation of the safe AI framework in Chai indicates the practicality of mitigating potential risks for responsible and ethical use of AI technologies. The ultimate vision is a transformative AI tool fostering progress and innovation while prioritizing user safety and ethical standards.	Arxiv
Arxiv_102	Training AI with strong and rich strategies in multi-agent environments remains an important research topic in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The AI's strength is closely related to its diversity of strategies, and this relationship can guide us to train AI with both strong and rich strategies. To prove this point, we propose Diversity is Strength (DIS), a novel DRL training framework that can simultaneously train multiple kinds of AIs. These AIs are linked through an interconnected history model pool structure, which enhances their capabilities and strategy diversities. We also design a model evaluation and screening scheme to select the best models to enrich the model pool and obtain the final AI. The proposed training method provides diverse, generalizable, and strong AI strategies without using human data. We tested our method in an AI competition based on Google Research Football (GRF) and won the 5v5 and 11v11 tracks. The method enables a GRF AI to have a high level on both 5v5 and 11v11 tracks for the first time, which are under complex multi-agent environments. The behavior analysis shows that the trained AI has rich strategies, and the ablation experiments proved that the designed modules benefit the training process.	Arxiv
Arxiv_103	Generative AI has made significant strides, yet concerns about the accuracy and reliability of its outputs continue to grow. Such inaccuracies can have serious consequences such as inaccurate decision-making, the spread of false information, privacy violations, legal liabilities, and more. Although efforts to address these risks are underway, including explainable AI and responsible AI practices such as transparency, privacy protection, bias mitigation, and social and environmental responsibility, misinformation caused by generative AI will remain a significant challenge. We propose that verifying the outputs of generative AI from a data management perspective is an emerging issue for generative AI. This involves analyzing the underlying data from multi-modal data lakes, including text files, tables, and knowledge graphs, and assessing its quality and consistency. By doing so, we can establish a stronger foundation for evaluating the outputs of generative AI models. Such an approach can ensure the correctness of generative AI, promote transparency, and enable decision-making with greater confidence. Our vision is to promote the development of verifiable generative AI and contribute to a more trustworthy and responsible use of AI.	Arxiv
Arxiv_104	Research on children's initial conceptions of AI is in an emerging state, which, from a constructivist viewpoint, challenges the development of pedagogically sound AI-literacy curricula, methods, and materials. To contribute to resolving this need in the present paper, qualitative survey data from 195 children were analyzed abductively to answer the following three research questions: What kind of misconceptions do Finnish 5th and 6th graders' have about the essence AI?; 2) How do these misconceptions relate to common misconception types?; and 3) How profound are these misconceptions? As a result, three misconception categories were identified: 1) Non-technological AI, in which AI was conceptualized as peoples' cognitive processes (factual misconception); 2) Anthropomorphic AI, in which AI was conceptualized as a human-like entity (vernacular, non-scientific, and conceptual misconception); and 3) AI as a machine with a pre-installed intelligence or knowledge (factual misconception). Majority of the children evaluated their AI-knowledge low, which implies that the misconceptions are more superficial than profound. The findings suggest that context-specific linguistic features can contribute to students' AI misconceptions. Implications for future research and AI literacy education are discussed.	Arxiv
Arxiv_105	"How does Artificial Intelligence (AI) affect the organization of work and the structure of wages? We study this question in a model where heterogeneous agents in terms of knowledge--humans and machines--endogenously sort into hierarchical teams: Less knowledgeable agents become ""workers"" (i.e., execute routine tasks), while more knowledgeable agents become ""managers"" (i.e., specialize in problem solving). When AI's knowledge is equivalent to that of a pre-AI worker, AI displaces humans from routine work into managerial work compared to the pre-AI outcome. In contrast, when AI's knowledge is that of a pre-AI manager, it shifts humans from managerial work to routine work. AI increases total human labor income, but it necessarily creates winners and losers: When AI's knowledge is low, only the most knowledgeable humans experience income gains. In contrast, when AI's knowledge is high, both extremes of the knowledge distribution benefit. In any case, the introduction of AI harms the middle class."	Arxiv
Arxiv_106	This paper investigates the dynamics of human AI collaboration in software engineering, focusing on the use of ChatGPT. Through a thematic analysis of a hands on workshop in which 22 professional software engineers collaborated for three hours with ChatGPT, we explore the transition of AI from a mere tool to a collaborative partner. The study identifies key themes such as the evolving nature of human AI interaction, the capabilities of AI in software engineering tasks, and the challenges and limitations of integrating AI in this domain. The findings show that while AI, particularly ChatGPT, improves the efficiency of code generation and optimization, human oversight remains crucial, especially in areas requiring complex problem solving and security considerations. This research contributes to the theoretical understanding of human AI collaboration in software engineering and provides practical insights for effectively integrating AI tools into development processes. It highlights the need for clear role allocation, effective communication, and balanced AI human collaboration to realize the full potential of AI in software engineering.	Arxiv
Arxiv_107	There are many goals for an AI that could become dangerous if the AI becomes superintelligent or otherwise powerful. Much work on the AI control problem has been focused on constructing AI goals that are safe even for such AIs. This paper looks at an alternative approach: defining a general concept of `low impact'. The aim is to ensure that a powerful AI which implements low impact will not modify the world extensively, even if it is given a simple or dangerous goal. The paper proposes various ways of defining and grounding low impact, and discusses methods for ensuring that the AI can still be allowed to have a (desired) impact despite the restriction. The end of the paper addresses known issues with this approach and avenues for future research.	Arxiv
Arxiv_108	The promise of AI is huge. AI systems have already achieved good enough performance to be in our streets and in our homes. However, they can be brittle and unfair. For society to reap the benefits of AI systems, society needs to be able to trust them. Inspired by decades of progress in trustworthy computing, we suggest what trustworthy properties would be desired of AI systems. By enumerating a set of new research questions, we explore one approach--formal verification--for ensuring trust in AI. Trustworthy AI ups the ante on both trustworthy computing and formal methods.

Arxiv_109	This paper explores the tension between openness and prudence in AI research, evident in two core principles of the Montr\'eal Declaration for Responsible AI. While the AI community has strong norms around open sharing of research, concerns about the potential harms arising from misuse of research are growing, prompting some to consider whether the field of AI needs to reconsider publication norms. We discuss how different beliefs and values can lead to differing perspectives on how the AI community should manage this tension, and explore implications for what responsible publication norms in AI research might look like in practice.

Arxiv_110	We are entering our tenth year of the current Artificial Intelligence (AI) spring, and, as with previous AI hype cycles, the threat of an AI winter looms. AI winters occurred because of ineffective approaches towards navigating the technology valley of death. The 6-D framework provides an end-to-end framework to successfully navigate this challenge. The 6-D framework starts with problem decomposition to identify potential AI solutions, and ends with considerations for deployment of AI-enabled systems. Each component of the 6-D framework and a precision medicine use case is described in this paper.	Arxiv

This framework incorporates value chain, supply chain, and ecosystem strategies.	Arxiv
Arxiv_112	DevOps and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are interconnected with each other. DevOps is a business-driven approach to providing quickly delivered quality software, and AI is the technology that can be used in the system to enhance its functionality. So, DevOps teams can use AI to test, code, release, monitor, and improve the system. Through AI, the automation process delivered by DevOps could be improved efficiently. This study aims to explore how AI can transform DevOps. The research is useful in terms of facilitating software developers and businesses to assess the importance of AI in DevOps. The study has practical implications as it elaborates on how AI transforms DevOps and in what way it can support businesses in their business.	Arxiv
Arxiv_113	Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly benefit or harm humanity. At present, a few for-profit companies largely control the development and use of this technology, and therefore determine its outcomes. In an effort to diversify and democratize work on AI, various groups are building open AI systems, investigating their risks, and discussing their ethics. In this paper, we demonstrate how blockchain technology can facilitate and formalize these efforts. Concretely, we analyze multiple use-cases for blockchain in AI research and development, including decentralized governance, the creation of immutable audit trails, and access to more diverse and representative datasets. We argue that decentralizing AI can help mitigate AI risks and ethical concerns, while also introducing new issues that should be considered in future work.	Arxiv
Arxiv_114	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities, prompting us to reconsider the future of human-AI co-creation and how humans interact with LLMs. In this paper, we present a spectrum of content generation tasks and their corresponding human-AI interaction patterns. These tasks include: 1) fixed-scope content curation tasks with minimal human-AI interactions, 2) independent creative tasks with precise human-AI interactions, and 3) complex and interdependent creative tasks with iterative human-AI interactions. We encourage the generative AI and HCI research communities to focus on the more complex and interdependent tasks, which require greater levels of human involvement.	Arxiv

Through the Fencing Hallucination project, the article reflects on the design of AI art production in alleviating the sense of uniformity, maintaining the uniqueness of images from an AI image synthesizer, and enhancing the connection between the artworks and the audience. This paper endeavors to stimulate the creation of distinctive AI art by recounting the efforts and insights derived from the Fencing Hallucination project, all dedicated to addressing the issue of ""sameness""."

Arxiv_116	Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in high-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often undesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's to ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately \textit{calibrate} human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.

Arxiv_117	"AI practitioners typically strive to develop the most accurate systems, making an implicit assumption that the AI system will function autonomously. However, in practice, AI systems often are used to provide advice to people in domains ranging from criminal justice and finance to healthcare. In such AI-advised decision making, humans and machines form a team, where the human is responsible for making final decisions. But is the most accurate AI the best teammate? We argue ""No"" -- predictable performance may be worth a slight sacrifice in AI accuracy. Instead, we argue that AI systems should be trained in a human-centered manner, directly optimized for team performance. We study this proposal for a specific type of human-AI teaming, where the human overseer chooses to either accept the AI recommendation or solve the task themselves. To optimize the team performance for this setting we maximize the team's expected utility, expressed in terms of the quality of the final decision, cost of verifying, and individual accuracies of people and machines. Our experiments with linear and non-linear models on real-world, high-stakes datasets show that the most accuracy AI may not lead to highest team performance and show the benefit of modeling teamwork during training through improvements in expected team utility across datasets, considering parameters such as human skill and the cost of mistakes. We discuss the shortcoming of current optimization approaches beyond well-studied loss functions such as log-loss, and encourage future work on AI optimization problems motivated by human-AI collaboration."

Arxiv_118	While AI has benefited humans, it may also harm humans if not appropriately developed. The focus of HCI work is transiting from conventional human interaction with non-AI computing systems to interaction with AI systems. We conducted a high-level literature review and a holistic analysis of current work in developing AI systems from an HCI perspective. Our review and analysis highlight the new changes introduced by AI technology and the new challenges that HCI professionals face when applying the human-centered AI (HCAI) approach in the development of AI systems. We also identified seven main issues in human interaction with AI systems, which HCI professionals did not encounter when developing non-AI computing systems. To further enable the implementation of the HCAI approach, we identified new HCI opportunities tied to specific HCAI-driven design goals to guide HCI professionals in addressing these new issues. Finally, our assessment of current HCI methods shows the limitations of these methods in support of developing AI systems. We propose alternative methods that can help overcome these limitations and effectively help HCI professionals apply the HCAI approach to the development of AI systems. We also offer strategic recommendations for HCI professionals to effectively influence the development of AI systems with the HCAI approach, eventually developing HCAI systems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_119	In the past few decades, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has experienced swift developments, changing everyone's daily life and profoundly altering the course of human society. The intention of developing AI is to benefit humans, by reducing human labor, bringing everyday convenience to human lives, and promoting social good. However, recent research and AI applications show that AI can cause unintentional harm to humans, such as making unreliable decisions in safety-critical scenarios or undermining fairness by inadvertently discriminating against one group. Thus, trustworthy AI has attracted immense attention recently, which requires careful consideration to avoid the adverse effects that AI may bring to humans, so that humans can fully trust and live in harmony with AI technologies.   Recent years have witnessed a tremendous amount of research on trustworthy AI. In this survey, we present a comprehensive survey of trustworthy AI from a computational perspective, to help readers understand the latest technologies for achieving trustworthy AI. Trustworthy AI is a large and complex area, involving various dimensions. In this work, we focus on six of the most crucial dimensions in achieving trustworthy AI: (i) Safety & Robustness, (ii) Non-discrimination & Fairness, (iii) Explainability, (iv) Privacy, (v) Accountability & Auditability, and (vi) Environmental Well-Being. For each dimension, we review the recent related technologies according to a taxonomy and summarize their applications in real-world systems. We also discuss the accordant and conflicting interactions among different dimensions and discuss potential aspects for trustworthy AI to investigate in the future.	Arxiv
Arxiv_120	"Modern consumer electronic devices often provide intelligence services with deep neural networks. We have started migrating the computing locations of intelligence services from cloud servers (traditional AI systems) to the corresponding devices (on-device AI systems). On-device AI systems generally have the advantages of preserving privacy, removing network latency, and saving cloud costs. With the emergent of on-device AI systems having relatively low computing power, the inconsistent and varying hardware resources and capabilities pose difficulties. Authors' affiliation has started applying a stream pipeline framework, NNStreamer, for on-device AI systems, saving developmental costs and hardware resources and improving performance. We want to expand the types of devices and applications with on-device AI services products of both the affiliation and second/third parties. We also want to make each AI service atomic, re-deployable, and shared among connected devices of arbitrary vendors; we now have yet another requirement introduced as it always has been. The new requirement of ""among-device AI"" includes connectivity between AI pipelines so that they may share computing resources and hardware capabilities across a wide range of devices regardless of vendors and manufacturers. We propose extensions of the stream pipeline framework, NNStreamer, for on-device AI so that NNStreamer may provide among-device AI capability. This work is a Linux Foundation (LF AI and Data) open source project accepting contributions from the general public."	Arxiv

Arxiv_122	"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) systems suggests that artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems may soon arrive. Many researchers are concerned that AIs and AGIs will harm humans via intentional misuse (AI-misuse) or through accidents (AI-accidents). In respect of AI-accidents, there is an increasing effort focused on developing algorithms and paradigms that ensure AI systems are aligned to what humans intend, e.g. AI systems that yield actions or recommendations that humans might judge as consistent with their intentions and goals. Here we argue that alignment to human intent is insufficient for safe AI systems and that preservation of long-term agency of humans may be a more robust standard, and one that needs to be separated explicitly and a priori during optimization. We argue that AI systems can reshape human intention and discuss the lack of biological and psychological mechanisms that protect humans from loss of agency. We provide the first formal definition of agency-preserving AI-human interactions which focuses on forward-looking agency evaluations and argue that AI systems - not humans - must be increasingly tasked with making these evaluations. We show how agency loss can occur in simple environments containing embedded agents that use temporal-difference learning to make action recommendations. Finally, we propose a new area of research called ""agency foundations"" and pose four initial topics designed to improve our understanding of agency in AI-human interactions: benevolent game theory, algorithmic foundations of human rights, mechanistic interpretability of agency representation in neural-networks and reinforcement learning from internal states."

Arxiv_123	In recent years, Artificial intelligence products and services have been offered potential users as pilots. The acceptance intention towards artificial intelligence is greatly influenced by the experience with current AI products and services, expectations for AI, and past experiences with ICT technology. This study aims to explore the factors that impact AI acceptance intention and understand the process of its formation. The analysis results of this study reveal that AI experience and past ICT experience affect AI acceptance intention in two ways. Through the direct path, higher AI experience and ICT experience are associated with a greater intention to accept AI. Additionally, there is an indirect path where AI experience and ICT experience contribute to increased expectations for AI, and these expectations, in turn, elevate acceptance intention. Based on the findings, several recommendations are suggested for companies and public organizations planning to implement artificial intelligence in the future. It is crucial to manage the user experience of ICT services and pilot AI products and services to deliver positive experiences. It is essential to provide potential AI users with specific information about the features and benefits of AI products and services. This will enable them to develop realistic expectations regarding AI technology.	Arxiv
Arxiv_124	Prior work has established the importance of integrating AI ethics topics into computer and data sciences curricula. We provide evidence suggesting that one of the critical objectives of AI Ethics education must be to raise awareness of AI harms. While there are various sources to learn about such harms, The AI Incident Database (AIID) is one of the few attempts at offering a relatively comprehensive database indexing prior instances of harms or near harms stemming from the deployment of AI technologies in the real world. This study assesses the effectiveness of AIID as an educational tool to raise awareness regarding the prevalence and severity of AI harms in socially high-stakes domains. We present findings obtained through a classroom study conducted at an R1 institution as part of a course focused on the societal and ethical considerations around AI and ML. Our qualitative findings characterize students' initial perceptions of core topics in AI ethics and their desire to close the educational gap between their technical skills and their ability to think systematically about ethical and societal aspects of their work. We find that interacting with the database helps students better understand the magnitude and severity of AI harms and instills in them a sense of urgency around (a) designing functional and safe AI and (b) strengthening governance and accountability mechanisms. Finally, we compile students' feedback about the tool and our class activity into actionable recommendations for the database development team and the broader community to improve awareness of AI harms in AI ethics education.

Arxiv_125	Efforts in levering Artificial Intelligence (AI) in decision support systems have disproportionately focused on technological advancements, often overlooking the alignment between algorithmic outputs and human expectations. To address this, explainable AI promotes AI development from a more human-centered perspective. Determining what information AI should provide to aid humans is vital, however, how the information is presented, e. g., the sequence of recommendations and the solicitation of interpretations, is equally crucial. This motivates the need to more precisely study Human-AI interaction as a pivotal component of AI-based decision support. While several empirical studies have evaluated Human-AI interactions in multiple application domains in which interactions can take many forms, there is not yet a common vocabulary to describe human-AI interaction protocols. To address this gap, we describe the results of a systematic review of the AI-assisted decision making literature, analyzing 105 selected articles, which grounds the introduction of a taxonomy of interaction patterns that delineate various modes of human-AI interactivity. We find that current interactions are dominated by simplistic collaboration paradigms and report comparatively little support for truly interactive functionality. Our taxonomy serves as a valuable tool to understand how interactivity with AI is currently supported in decision-making contexts and foster deliberate choices of interaction designs.	Arxiv
Arxiv_126	Innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) are occurring at speeds faster than ever witnessed before. However, few studies have managed to measure or depict this increasing velocity of innovations in the field of AI. In this paper, we combine data on AI from arXiv and Semantic Scholar to explore the pace of AI innovations from three perspectives: AI publications, AI players, and AI updates (trial and error). A research framework and three novel indicators, Average Time Interval (ATI), Innovation Speed (IS) and Update Speed (US), are proposed to measure the pace of innovations in the field of AI. The results show that: (1) in 2019, more than 3 AI preprints were submitted to arXiv per hour, over 148 times faster than in 1994. Furthermore, there was one deep learning-related preprint submitted to arXiv every 0.87 hours in 2019, over 1,064 times faster than in 1994. (2) For AI players, 5.26 new researchers entered into the field of AI each hour in 2019, more than 175 times faster than in the 1990s. (3) As for AI updates (trial and error), one updated AI preprint was submitted to arXiv every 41 days, with around 33% of AI preprints having been updated at least twice in 2019. In addition, as reported in 2019, it took, on average, only around 0.2 year for AI preprints to receive their first citations, which is 5 times faster than 2000-2007. This swift pace in AI illustrates the increase in popularity of AI innovation. The systematic and fine-grained analysis of the AI field enabled to portrait the pace of AI innovation and demonstrated that the proposed approach can be adopted to understand other fast-growing fields such as cancer research and nano science.

Arxiv_127	Details of the designs and mechanisms in support of human-AI collaboration must be considered in the real-world fielding of AI technologies. A critical aspect of interaction design for AI-assisted human decision making are policies about the display and sequencing of AI inferences within larger decision-making workflows. We have a poor understanding of the influences of making AI inferences available before versus after human review of a diagnostic task at hand. We explore the effects of providing AI assistance at the start of a diagnostic session in radiology versus after the radiologist has made a provisional decision. We conducted a user study where 19 veterinary radiologists identified radiographic findings present in patients' X-ray images, with the aid of an AI tool. We employed two workflow configurations to analyze (i) anchoring effects, (ii) human-AI team diagnostic performance and agreement, (iii) time spent and confidence in decision making, and (iv) perceived usefulness of the AI. We found that participants who are asked to register provisional responses in advance of reviewing AI inferences are less likely to agree with the AI regardless of whether the advice is accurate and, in instances of disagreement with the AI, are less likely to seek the second opinion of a colleague. These participants also reported the AI advice to be less useful. Surprisingly, requiring provisional decisions on cases in advance of the display of AI inferences did not lengthen the time participants spent on the task. The study provides generalizable and actionable insights for the deployment of clinical AI tools in human-in-the-loop systems and introduces a methodology for studying alternative designs for human-AI collaboration. We make our experimental platform available as open source to facilitate future research on the influence of alternate designs on human-AI workflows.	Arxiv
Arxiv_128	Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can provide many beneficial capabilities but also risks of adverse events. Some AI systems could present risks of events with very high or catastrophic consequences at societal scale. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been developing the NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) as voluntary guidance on AI risk assessment and management for AI developers and others. For addressing risks of events with catastrophic consequences, NIST indicated a need to translate from high level principles to actionable risk management guidance.   In this document, we provide detailed actionable-guidance recommendations focused on identifying and managing risks of events with very high or catastrophic consequences, intended as a risk management practices resource for NIST for AI RMF version 1.0 (released in January 2023), or for AI RMF users, or for other AI risk management guidance and standards as appropriate. We also provide our methodology for our recommendations.   We provide actionable-guidance recommendations for AI RMF 1.0 on: identifying risks from potential unintended uses and misuses of AI systems; including catastrophic-risk factors within the scope of risk assessments and impact assessments; identifying and mitigating human rights harms; and reporting information on AI risk factors including catastrophic-risk factors.   In addition, we provide recommendations on additional issues for a roadmap for later versions of the AI RMF or supplementary publications. These include: providing an AI RMF Profile with supplementary guidance for cutting-edge increasingly multi-purpose or general-purpose AI.   We aim for this work to be a concrete risk-management practices contribution, and to stimulate constructive dialogue on how to address catastrophic risks and associated issues in AI standards.	Arxiv
Arxiv_129	With various AI tools such as ChatGPT becoming increasingly popular, we are entering a true AI era. We can foresee that exceptional AI tools will soon reap considerable profits. A crucial question arise: should AI tools share revenue with their training data providers in additional to traditional stakeholders and shareholders? The answer is Yes. Large AI tools, such as large language models, always require more and better quality data to continuously improve, but current copyright laws limit their access to various types of data. Sharing revenue between AI tools and their data providers could transform the current hostile zero-sum game relationship between AI tools and a majority of copyrighted data owners into a collaborative and mutually beneficial one, which is necessary to facilitate the development of a virtuous cycle among AI tools, their users and data providers that drives forward AI technology and builds a healthy AI ecosystem. However, current revenue-sharing business models do not work for AI tools in the forthcoming AI era, since the most widely used metrics for website-based traffic and action, such as clicks, will be replaced by new metrics such as prompts and cost per prompt for generative AI tools. A completely new revenue-sharing business model, which must be almost independent of AI tools and be easily explained to data providers, needs to establish a prompt-based scoring system to measure data engagement of each data provider. This paper systematically discusses how to build such a scoring system for all data providers for AI tools based on classification and content similarity models, and outlines the requirements for AI tools or third parties to build it. Sharing revenue with data providers using such a scoring system would encourage more data owners to participate in the revenue-sharing program. This will be a utilitarian AI era where all parties benefit.	Arxiv
Arxiv_130	Mainstream approaches for creating AIs include deep learning and generative approaches (e.g., large language models) and manually constructed symbolic approaches. These approaches have led to valuable AI systems and impressive feats, but they can create risks when their operations affect people. Manually constructed AIs are brittle even in circumscribed domains. Generative AIs can make strange mistakes and not notice them. Today, these AIs cannot be instructed easily, fail to use common sense, lack curiosity, and lack social alignment. Developmental AI is a bootstrapping approach that uses embodied AIs. The AIs start with innate competences and learn by interacting with their environment. The AIs develop abilities in small steps along a bio-inspired trajectory. Developmental AIs have shown capabilities for multimodal perception, object recognition, and manipulation. Computational models for hierarchical planning, abstraction discovery, curiosity, and language acquisition exist but need to be adapted to an embodied approach. This research aims to produce AIs that learn to communicate, establish common ground, read critically, consider the provenance of information, test hypotheses, and collaborate. However, developmental AI systems have not yet passed the abilities of young children. They need to bridge competence gaps involving nonverbal communication, speech, reading, and writing. Scaling to practical applications also requires reducing hardware costs. This position paper lays out prospects, gaps, and challenges for this approach. The ambition is to create data-rich experientially based foundation models for human-compatible, resilient, and trustworthy AIs. The AIs would learn, share what they learn, and collaborate to achieve high standards. The approach would make AI technology more democratic and enable more people to train, test, build on, and replicate AIs.	Arxiv
Arxiv_131	Participants in recent discussions of AI-related issues ranging from intelligence explosion to technological unemployment have made diverse claims about the nature, pace, and drivers of progress in AI. However, these theories are rarely specified in enough detail to enable systematic evaluation of their assumptions or to extrapolate progress quantitatively, as is often done with some success in other technological domains. After reviewing relevant literatures and justifying the need for more rigorous modeling of AI progress, this paper contributes to that research program by suggesting ways to account for the relationship between hardware speed increases and algorithmic improvements in AI, the role of human inputs in enabling AI capabilities, and the relationships between different sub-fields of AI. It then outlines ways of tailoring AI progress models to generate insights on the specific issue of technological unemployment, and outlines future directions for research on AI progress.	Arxiv
Arxiv_132	With the great success of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in pattern recognitions and signal processing, it is interesting to introduce AI technologies into wireless communication systems. Currently, most of studies are focused on applying AI technologies for solving old problems, e.g., wireless location accuracy and resource allocation optimization in wireless communication systems. However, It is important to distinguish new capabilities created by AI technologies and rethink wireless communication systems based on AI running schemes. Compared with conventional capabilities of wireless communication systems, three distinguished capabilities, i.e., the cognitive, learning and proactive capabilities are proposed for future AI wireless communication systems. Moreover, an intelligent vehicular communication system is configured to validate the cognitive capability based on AI clustering algorithm. Considering the revolutionary impact of AI technologies on the data, transmission and protocol architecture of wireless communication systems, the future challenges of AI wireless communication systems are analyzed. Driven by new distinguished capabilities of AI wireless communication systems, the new wireless communication theory and functions would indeed emerge in the next round of the wireless communications revolution.

Arxiv_133	With the turmoil in cybersecurity and the mind-blowing advances in AI, it is only natural that cybersecurity practitioners consider further employing learning techniques to help secure their organizations and improve the efficiency of their security operation centers. But with great fears come great opportunities for both the good and the evil, and a myriad of bad deals. This paper discusses ten issues in cybersecurity that hopefully will make it easier for practitioners to ask detailed questions about what they want from an AI system in their cybersecurity operations. We draw on the state of the art to provide factual arguments for a discussion on well-established AI in cybersecurity issues, including the current scope of AI and its application to cybersecurity, the impact of privacy concerns on the cybersecurity data that can be collected and shared externally to the organization, how an AI decision can be explained to the person running the operations center, and the implications of the adversarial nature of cybersecurity in the learning techniques. We then discuss the use of AI by attackers on a level playing field including several issues in an AI battlefield, and an AI perspective on the old cat-and-mouse game including how the adversary may assess your AI power.

Arxiv_134	To facilitate the widespread acceptance of AI systems guiding decision-making in real-world applications, it is key that solutions comprise trustworthy, integrated human-AI systems. Not only in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving or medicine, but also in dynamic open world systems in industry and government it is crucial for predictive models to be uncertainty-aware and yield trustworthy predictions. Another key requirement for deployment of AI at enterprise scale is to realize the importance of integrating human-centered design into AI systems such that humans are able to use systems effectively, understand results and output, and explain findings to oversight committees.   While the focus of this symposium was on AI systems to improve data quality and technical robustness and safety, we welcomed submissions from broadly defined areas also discussing approaches addressing requirements such as explainable models, human trust and ethical aspects of AI.

In this paper, we are trying to address the following key question: To identify whether design, as well as development efforts for search oriented conversational AI are successful or not.It is tricky to define 'success' in the case of conversational AI and equally tricky part is to use appropriate metrics for the evaluation of conversational AI. We propose four different perspectives namely user experience, information retrieval, linguistic and artificial intelligence for the evaluation of conversational AI systems. Additionally, background details of conversational AI systems are provided including desirable characteristics of personal assistants, differences between chatbot and an AI based personal assistant. An importance of personalization and how it can be achieved is explained in detail. Current challenges in the development of an ideal conversational AI (personal assistant) are also highlighted along with guidelines for achieving personalized experience for users.	Arxiv
Arxiv_136	AI systems are being deployed to support human decision making in high-stakes domains. In many cases, the human and AI form a team, in which the human makes decisions after reviewing the AI's inferences. A successful partnership requires that the human develops insights into the performance of the AI system, including its failures. We study the influence of updates to an AI system in this setting. While updates can increase the AI's predictive performance, they may also lead to changes that are at odds with the user's prior experiences and confidence in the AI's inferences, hurting therefore the overall team performance. We introduce the notion of the compatibility of an AI update with prior user experience and present methods for studying the role of compatibility in human-AI teams. Empirical results on three high-stakes domains show that current machine learning algorithms do not produce compatible updates. We propose a re-training objective to improve the compatibility of an update by penalizing new errors. The objective offers full leverage of the performance/compatibility tradeoff, enabling more compatible yet accurate updates.	Arxiv
Arxiv_137	Envisioning a new imaginative idea together is a popular human need. Imagining together as a team can often lead to breakthrough ideas, but the collaboration effort can also be challenging, especially when the team members are separated by time and space. What if there is a AI that can assist the team to collaboratively envision new ideas?. Is it possible to develop a working model of such an AI? This paper aims to design such an intelligence. This paper proposes a approach to design a creative and collaborative intelligence by employing a form of distributed machine learning approach called Federated Learning along with fusion on Generative Adversarial Networks, GAN. This collaborative creative AI presents a new paradigm in AI, one that lets a team of two or more to come together to imagine and envision ideas that synergies well with interests of all members of the team. In short, this paper explores the design of a novel type of AI paradigm, called Federated AI Imagination, one that lets geographically distributed teams to collaboratively imagine.	Arxiv
Arxiv_138	"The debate on AI ethics largely focuses on technical improvements and stronger regulation to prevent accidents or misuse of AI, with solutions relying on holding individual actors accountable for responsible AI development. While useful and necessary, we argue that this ""agency"" approach disregards more indirect and complex risks resulting from AI's interaction with the socio-economic and political context. This paper calls for a ""structural"" approach to assessing AI's effects in order to understand and prevent such systemic risks where no individual can be held accountable for the broader negative impacts. This is particularly relevant for AI applied to systemic issues such as climate change and food security which require political solutions and global cooperation. To properly address the wide range of AI risks and ensure 'AI for social good', agency-focused policies must be complemented by policies informed by a structural approach."	Arxiv
Arxiv_139	"Is a new regulated profession, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) Architect who is responsible and accountable for AI outputs necessary to ensure trustworthy AI? AI is becoming all pervasive and is often deployed in everyday technologies, devices and services without our knowledge. There is heightened awareness of AI in recent years which has brought with it fear. This fear is compounded by the inability to point to a trustworthy source of AI, however even the term ""trustworthy AI"" itself is troublesome. Some consider trustworthy AI to be that which complies with relevant laws, while others point to the requirement to comply with ethics and standards (whether in addition to or in isolation of the law). This immediately raises questions of whose ethics and which standards should be applied and whether these are sufficient to produce trustworthy AI in any event."	Arxiv
Arxiv_140	The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has made various industries eager to explore the benefits of AI. There is an increasing amount of research surrounding AI, most of which is centred on the development of new AI algorithms and techniques. However, the advent of AI is bringing an increasing set of practical problems related to AI model lifecycle management that need to be investigated. We address this gap by conducting a systematic mapping study on the lifecycle of AI model. Through quantitative research, we provide an overview of the field, identify research opportunities, and provide suggestions for future research. Our study yields 405 publications published from 2005 to 2020, mapped in 5 different main research topics, and 31 sub-topics. We observe that only a minority of publications focus on data management and model production problems, and that more studies should address the AI lifecycle from a holistic perspective.	Arxiv
Arxiv_141	From its inception, AI has had a rather ambivalent relationship to humans---swinging between their augmentation and replacement. Now, as AI technologies enter our everyday lives at an ever increasing pace, there is a greater need for AI systems to work synergistically with humans. To do this effectively, AI systems must pay more attention to aspects of intelligence that helped humans work with each other---including social intelligence. I will discuss the research challenges in designing such human-aware AI systems, including modeling the mental states of humans in the loop, recognizing their desires and intentions, providing proactive support, exhibiting explicable behavior, giving cogent explanations on demand, and engendering trust. I will survey the progress made so far on these challenges, and highlight some promising directions. I will also touch on the additional ethical quandaries that such systems pose. I will end by arguing that the quest for human-aware AI systems broadens the scope of AI enterprise, necessitates and facilitates true inter-disciplinary collaborations, and can go a long way towards increasing public acceptance of AI technologies.

Arxiv_142	There appears to be a common agreement that ethical concerns are of high importance when it comes to systems equipped with some sort of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Demands for ethical AI are declared from all directions. As a response, in recent years, public bodies, governments, and universities have rushed in to provide a set of principles to be considered when AI based systems are designed and used. We have learned, however, that high-level principles do not turn easily into actionable advice for practitioners. Hence, also companies are publishing their own ethical guidelines to guide their AI development. This paper argues that AI software is still software and needs to be approached from the software development perspective. The software engineering paradigm has introduced maturity model thinking, which provides a roadmap for companies to improve their performance from the selected viewpoints known as the key capabilities. We want to voice out a call for action for the development of a maturity model for AI software. We wish to discuss whether the focus should be on AI ethics or, more broadly, the quality of an AI system, called a maturity model for the development of AI systems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_143	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a trusted advisor in people's lives. A new concern arises if AI persuades people to break ethical rules for profit. Employing a large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,572), we test whether AI-generated advice can corrupt people. We further test whether transparency about AI presence, a commonly proposed policy, mitigates potential harm of AI-generated advice. Using the Natural Language Processing algorithm, GPT-2, we generated honesty-promoting and dishonesty-promoting advice. Participants read one type of advice before engaging in a task in which they could lie for profit. Testing human behaviour in interaction with actual AI outputs, we provide first behavioural insights into the role of AI as an advisor. Results reveal that AI-generated advice corrupts people, even when they know the source of the advice. In fact, AI's corrupting force is as strong as humans'.	Arxiv
Arxiv_144	Recent years witness a trend of applying large-scale distributed deep learning algorithms (HPC AI) in both business and scientific computing areas, whose goal is to speed up the training time to achieve a state-of-the-art quality. The HPC AI benchmarks accelerate the process. Unfortunately, benchmarking HPC AI systems at scale raises serious challenges. This paper presents a representative, repeatable and simple HPC AI benchmarking methodology. Among the seventeen AI workloads of AIBench Training -- by far the most comprehensive AI Training benchmarks suite -- we choose two representative and repeatable AI workloads. The selected HPC AI benchmarks include both business and scientific computing: Image Classification and Extreme Weather Analytics. To rank HPC AI systems, we present a new metric named Valid FLOPS, emphasizing both throughput performance and a target quality. The specification, source code, datasets, and HPC AI500 ranking numbers are publicly available from \url{https://www.benchcouncil.org/HPCAI500/}.	Arxiv
Arxiv_145	This paper proposes a comprehensive analysis of existing concepts coming from different disciplines tackling the notion of intelligence, namely psychology and engineering, and from disciplines aiming to regulate AI innovations, namely AI ethics and law. The aim is to identify shared notions or discrepancies to consider for qualifying AI systems. Relevant concepts are integrated into a matrix intended to help defining more precisely when and how computing tools (programs or devices) may be qualified as AI while highlighting critical features to serve a specific technical, ethical and legal assessment of challenges in AI development. Some adaptations of existing notions of AI characteristics are proposed. The matrix is a risk-based conceptual model designed to allow an empirical, flexible and scalable qualification of AI technologies in the perspective of benefit-risk assessment practices, technological monitoring and regulatory compliance: it offers a structured reflection tool for stakeholders in AI development that are engaged in responsible research and innovation.Pre-print version (achieved on May 2020)	Arxiv
Arxiv_146	With the global roll-out of the fifth generation (5G) networks, it is necessary to look beyond 5G and envision the 6G networks. The 6G networks are expected to have space-air-ground integrated networks, advanced network virtualization, and ubiquitous intelligence. This article presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-native network slicing architecture for 6G networks to enable the synergy of AI and network slicing, thereby facilitating intelligent network management and supporting emerging AI services. AI-based solutions are first discussed across network slicing lifecycle to intelligently manage network slices, i.e., AI for slicing. Then, network slicing solutions are studied to support emerging AI services by constructing AI instances and performing efficient resource management, i.e., slicing for AI. Finally, a case study is presented, followed by a discussion of open research issues that are essential for AI-native network slicing in 6G networks.	Arxiv
Arxiv_147	Limited expert time is a key bottleneck in medical imaging. Due to advances in image classification, AI can now serve as decision-support for medical experts, with the potential for great gains in radiologist productivity and, by extension, public health. However, these gains are contingent on building and maintaining experts' trust in the AI agents. Explainable AI may build such trust by helping medical experts to understand the AI decision processes behind diagnostic judgements. Here we introduce and evaluate explanations based on Bayesian Teaching, a formal account of explanation rooted in the cognitive science of human learning. We find that medical experts exposed to explanations generated by Bayesian Teaching successfully predict the AI's diagnostic decisions and are more likely to certify the AI for cases when the AI is correct than when it is wrong, indicating appropriate trust. These results show that Explainable AI can be used to support human-AI collaboration in medical imaging.	Arxiv
Arxiv_148	Recently, the use of sound measures and metrics in Artificial Intelligence has become the subject of interest of academia, government, and industry. Efforts towards measuring different phenomena have gained traction in the AI community, as illustrated by the publication of several influential field reports and policy documents. These metrics are designed to help decision takers to inform themselves about the fast-moving and impacting influences of key advances in Artificial Intelligence in general and Machine Learning in particular. In this paper we propose to use such newfound capabilities of AI technologies to augment our AI measuring capabilities. We do so by training a model to classify publications related to ethical issues and concerns. In our methodology we use an expert, manually curated dataset as the training set and then evaluate a large set of research papers. Finally, we highlight the implications of AI metrics, in particular their contribution towards developing trustful and fair AI-based tools and technologies.

Arxiv_149	Recent AI governance research has focused heavily on the analysis of strategy papers and ethics guidelines for AI published by national governments and international bodies. Meanwhile, subnational institutions have also published documents on Artificial Intelligence, yet these have been largely absent from policy analyses. This is surprising because AI is connected to many policy areas, such as economic or research policy, where the competences are already distributed between the national and subnational level. To better understand the current dynamics of AI governance, it is essential to consider the context of policy making beyond the federal government. Although AI may be considered a new policy field, it is created, contested and ultimately shaped within existing political structures and dynamics. We therefore argue that more attention should be dedicated to subnational efforts to shape AI and present initial findings from our case study of Germany. Analyzing AI as a policy field on different levels of government will contribute to a better understanding of the developments and implementations of AI strategies in different national contexts.

Arxiv_150	Advances in machine learning (ML) technologies have greatly improved Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. As a result, AI systems have become ubiquitous, with their application prevalent in virtually all sectors. However, AI systems have prompted ethical concerns, especially as their usage crosses boundaries in sensitive areas such as healthcare, transportation, and security. As a result, users are calling for better AI governance practices in ethical AI systems. Therefore, AI development methods are encouraged to foster these practices. This research analyzes the ECCOLA method for developing ethical and trustworthy AI systems to determine if it enables AI governance in development processes through ethical practices. The results demonstrate that while ECCOLA fully facilitates AI governance in corporate governance practices in all its processes, some of its practices do not fully foster data governance and information governance practices. This indicates that the method can be further improved.	Arxiv
Arxiv_151	Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significant potential for product design: AI can check technical and non-technical constraints on products, it can support a quick design of new product variants and new AI methods may also support creativity. But currently product design and AI are separate communities fostering different terms and theories. This makes a mapping of AI approaches to product design needs difficult and prevents new solutions. As a solution, this paper first clarifies important terms and concepts for the interdisciplinary domain of AI methods in product design. A key contribution of this paper is a new classification of design problems using the four characteristics decomposability, inter-dependencies, innovation and creativity. Definitions of these concepts are given where they are lacking. Early mappings of these concepts to AI solutions are sketched and verified using design examples. The importance of creativity in product design and a corresponding gap in AI is pointed out for future research.	Arxiv
Arxiv_152	Massive efforts are made to reduce biases in both data and algorithms in order to render AI applications fair. These efforts are propelled by various high-profile cases where biased algorithmic decision-making caused harm to women, people of color, minorities, etc. However, the AI fairness field still succumbs to a blind spot, namely its insensitivity to discrimination against animals. This paper is the first to describe the 'speciesist bias' and investigate it in several different AI systems. Speciesist biases are learned and solidified by AI applications when they are trained on datasets in which speciesist patterns prevail. These patterns can be found in image recognition systems, large language models, and recommender systems. Therefore, AI technologies currently play a significant role in perpetuating and normalizing violence against animals. This can only be changed when AI fairness frameworks widen their scope and include mitigation measures for speciesist biases. This paper addresses the AI community in this regard and stresses the influence AI systems can have on either increasing or reducing the violence that is inflicted on animals, and especially on farmed animals.	Arxiv
Arxiv_153	Over the last years, the rising capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) have improved human decision-making in many application areas. Teaming between AI and humans may even lead to complementary team performance (CTP), i.e., a level of performance beyond the ones that can be reached by AI or humans individually. Many researchers have proposed using explainable AI (XAI) to enable humans to rely on AI advice appropriately and thereby reach CTP. However, CTP is rarely demonstrated in previous work as often the focus is on the design of explainability, while a fundamental prerequisite -- the presence of complementarity potential between humans and AI -- is often neglected. Therefore, we focus on the existence of this potential for effective human-AI decision-making. Specifically, we identify information asymmetry as an essential source of complementarity potential, as in many real-world situations, humans have access to different contextual information. By conducting an online experiment, we demonstrate that humans can use such contextual information to adjust the AI's decision, finally resulting in CTP.	Arxiv
Arxiv_154	With the growing need to regulate AI systems across a wide variety of application domains, a new set of occupations has emerged in the industry. The so-called responsible AI practitioners or AI ethicists are generally tasked with interpreting and operationalizing best practices for ethical and safe design of AI systems. Due to the nascent nature of these roles, however, it is unclear to future employers and aspiring AI ethicists what specific function these roles serve and what skills are necessary to serve the functions. Without clarity on these, we cannot train future AI ethicists with meaningful learning objectives.   In this work, we examine what responsible AI practitioners do in the industry and what skills they employ on the job. We propose an ontology of existing roles alongside skills and competencies that serve each role. We created this ontology by examining the job postings for such roles over a two-year period (2020-2022) and conducting expert interviews with fourteen individuals who currently hold such a role in the industry. Our ontology contributes to business leaders looking to build responsible AI teams and provides educators with a set of competencies that an AI ethics curriculum can prioritize.	Arxiv
Arxiv_155	The tremendous achievements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in computer vision, natural language processing, games and robotics, has extended the reach of the AI hype to other fields: in telecommunication networks, the long term vision is to let AI fully manage, and autonomously drive, all aspects of network operation. In this industry vision paper, we discuss challenges and opportunities of Autonomous Driving Network (ADN) driven by AI technologies. To understand how AI can be successfully landed in current and future networks, we start by outlining challenges that are specific to the networking domain, putting them in perspective with advances that AI has achieved in other fields. We then present a system view, clarifying how AI can be fitted in the network architecture. We finally discuss current achievements as well as future promises of AI in networks, mentioning a roadmap to avoid bumps in the road that leads to true large-scale deployment of AI technologies in networks.

Arxiv_156	Since the first AI-HRI held at the 2014 AAAI Fall Symposium Series, a lot of the presented research and discussions have emphasized how artificial intelligence (AI) developments can benefit human-robot interaction (HRI). This portrays HRI as an application, a source of domain-specific problems to solve, to the AI community. Likewise, this portrays AI as a tool, a source of solutions available for relevant problems, to the HRI community. However, members of the AI-HRI research community will point out that the relationship has a deeper synergy than matchmaking problems and solutions -- there are insights from each field that impact how the other one thinks about the world and performs scientific research. There is no greater opportunity for sharing perspectives at the moment than human-aware AI, which studies how to account for the fact that people are more than a source of data or part of an algorithm. We will explore how AI-HRI can change the way researchers think about human-aware AI, from observation through validation, to make even the algorithmic design process human-aware.	Arxiv
Arxiv_157	There is a bidirectional relationship between culture and AI; AI models are increasingly used to analyse culture, thereby shaping our understanding of culture. On the other hand, the models are trained on collections of cultural artifacts thereby implicitly, and not always correctly, encoding expressions of culture. This creates a tension that both limits the use of AI for analysing culture and leads to problems in AI with respect to cultural complex issues such as bias.   One approach to overcome this tension is to more extensively take into account the intricacies and complexities of culture. We structure our discussion using four concepts that guide humanistic inquiry into culture: subjectivity, scalability, contextuality, and temporality. We focus on these concepts because they have not yet been sufficiently represented in AI research. We believe that possible implementations of these aspects into AI research leads to AI that better captures the complexities of culture. In what follows, we briefly describe these four concepts and their absence in AI research. For each concept, we define possible research challenges.	Arxiv
Arxiv_158	As the real-world impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has been steadily growing, so too have these systems come under increasing scrutiny. In response, the study of AI fairness has rapidly developed into a rich field of research with links to computer science, social science, law, and philosophy. Many technical solutions for measuring and achieving AI fairness have been proposed, yet their approach has been criticized in recent years for being misleading, unrealistic and harmful.   In our paper, we survey these criticisms of AI fairness and identify key limitations that are inherent to the prototypical paradigm of AI fairness. By carefully outlining the extent to which technical solutions can realistically help in achieving AI fairness, we aim to provide the background necessary to form a nuanced opinion on developments in fair AI. This delineation also provides research opportunities for non-AI solutions peripheral to AI systems in supporting fair decision processes.	Arxiv
Arxiv_159	The recent release of ChatGPT has gained huge attention and discussion worldwide, with responsible AI being a key topic of discussion. How can we ensure that AI systems, including ChatGPT, are developed and adopted in a responsible way? To tackle the responsible AI challenges, various ethical principles have been released by governments, organisations, and companies. However, those principles are very abstract and not practical enough. Further, significant efforts have been put on algorithm-level solutions that only address a narrow set of principles, such as fairness and privacy. To fill the gap, we adopt a pattern-oriented responsible AI engineering approach and build a Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue to operationalise responsible AI from a system perspective. In this article, we first summarise the major challenges in operationalising responsible AI at scale and introduce how we use the Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue to address those challenges. We then examine the risks at each stage of the chatbot development process and recommend pattern-driven mitigations to evaluate the the usefulness of the Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue in a real-world setting.

Arxiv_160	"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of powerful AI chatbots capable of engaging in natural and human-like conversations. However, these chatbots can be potentially harmful, exhibiting manipulative, gaslighting, and narcissistic behaviors. We define Healthy AI to be safe, trustworthy and ethical. To create healthy AI systems, we present the SafeguardGPT framework that uses psychotherapy to correct for these harmful behaviors in AI chatbots. The framework involves four types of AI agents: a Chatbot, a ""User,"" a ""Therapist,"" and a ""Critic."" We demonstrate the effectiveness of SafeguardGPT through a working example of simulating a social conversation. Our results show that the framework can improve the quality of conversations between AI chatbots and humans. Although there are still several challenges and directions to be addressed in the future, SafeguardGPT provides a promising approach to improving the alignment between AI chatbots and human values. By incorporating psychotherapy and reinforcement learning techniques, the framework enables AI chatbots to learn and adapt to human preferences and values in a safe and ethical way, contributing to the development of a more human-centric and responsible AI."

Arxiv_161	With the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry and society, effective human-AI interaction systems are becoming increasingly important. A central challenge in the interaction of humans with AI is the estimation of difficulty for human and AI agents for single task instances.These estimations are crucial to evaluate each agent's capabilities and, thus, required to facilitate effective collaboration. So far, research in the field of human-AI interaction estimates the perceived difficulty of humans and AI independently from each other. However, the effective interaction of human and AI agents depends on metrics that accurately reflect each agent's perceived difficulty in achieving valuable outcomes. Research to date has not yet adequately examined the differences in the perceived difficulty of humans and AI. Thus, this work reviews recent research on the perceived difficulty in human-AI interaction and contributing factors to consistently compare each agent's perceived difficulty, e.g., creating the same prerequisites. Furthermore, we present an experimental design to thoroughly examine the perceived difficulty of both agents and contribute to a better understanding of the design of such systems.	Arxiv

Its vagueness and the prominence of UX designers as speakers and writers in the spectacle of cultural AI discourse. The article then, draws comparisons between the Theatre of the Absurd and the UX designer performances of design AI. It additionally sheds light on ToA and the human condition in terms of existentialism, present within the practice of engaging in design that intends to link human experience to technological system logic.

Arxiv_163	The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), represented by ChatGPT, has raised concerns about responsible AI development and utilization. Existing frameworks lack a comprehensive synthesis of AI risk assessment questions. To address this, we introduce QB4AIRA, a novel question bank developed by refining questions from five globally recognized AI risk frameworks, categorized according to Australia's AI ethics principles. QB4AIRA comprises 293 prioritized questions covering a wide range of AI risk areas, facilitating effective risk assessment. It serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders in assessing and managing AI risks, while paving the way for new risk frameworks and guidelines. By promoting responsible AI practices, QB4AIRA contributes to responsible AI deployment, mitigating potential risks and harms.	Arxiv
Arxiv_164	Generative AI tools introduce new and accessible forms of media creation for youth. They also raise ethical concerns about the generation of fake media, data protection, privacy and ownership of AI-generated art. Since generative AI is already being used in products used by youth, it is critical that they understand how these tools work and how they can be used or misused. In this work, we facilitated students' generative AI learning through expression of their imagined future identities. We designed a learning workshop - Dreaming with AI - where students learned about the inner workings of generative AI tools, used text-to-image generation algorithms to create their imaged future dreams, reflected on the potential benefits and harms of generative AI tools and voiced their opinions about policies for the use of these tools in classrooms. In this paper, we present the learning activities and experiences of 34 high school students who engaged in our workshops. Students reached creative learning objectives by using prompt engineering to create their future dreams, gained technical knowledge by learning the abilities, limitations, text-visual mappings and applications of generative AI, and identified most potential societal benefits and harms of generative AI.

Arxiv_165	With the emergence of deep learning techniques, smartphone apps are now embedded on-device AI features for enabling advanced tasks like speech translation, to attract users and increase market competitiveness. A good interaction design is important to make an AI feature usable and understandable. However, AI features have their unique challenges like sensitiveness to the input, dynamic behaviours and output uncertainty. Existing guidelines and tools either do not cover AI features or consider mobile apps which are confirmed by our informal interview with professional designers. To address these issues, we conducted the first empirical study to explore user-AI-interaction in mobile apps. We aim to understand the status of on-device AI usage by investigating 176 AI apps from 62,822 apps. We identified 255 AI features and summarised 759 implementations into three primary interaction pattern types. We further implemented our findings into a multi-faceted search-enabled gallery. The results of the user study demonstrate the usefulness of our findings.	Arxiv
Arxiv_166	Precision medicine, tailored to individual patients based on their genetics, environment, and lifestyle, shows promise in managing complex diseases like infections. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into precision medicine can revolutionize disease management. This paper introduces a novel approach using AI to advance precision medicine in infectious diseases and beyond. It integrates diverse fields, analyzing patients' profiles using genomics, proteomics, microbiomics, and clinical data. AI algorithms process vast data, providing insights for precise diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. AI-driven predictive modeling empowers healthcare providers to make personalized and effective interventions. Collaboration among experts from different domains refines AI models and ensures ethical and robust applications. Beyond infections, this AI-driven approach can benefit other complex diseases. Precision medicine powered by AI has the potential to transform healthcare into a proactive, patient-centric model. Research is needed to address privacy, regulations, and AI integration into clinical workflows. Collaboration among researchers, healthcare institutions, and policymakers is crucial in harnessing AI-driven strategies for advancing precision medicine and improving patient outcomes.	Arxiv
Arxiv_167	Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with an interest in AI ethics need more integrative approaches for studying and intervening in AI systems across many contexts and scales of activity. This paper presents AI value chains as an integrative concept that satisfies that need. To more clearly theorize AI value chains and conceptually distinguish them from supply chains, we review theories of value chains and AI value chains from the strategic management, service science, economic geography, industry, government, and applied research literature. We then conduct an integrative review of a sample of 67 sources that cover the ethical concerns implicated in AI value chains. Building upon the findings of our integrative review, we recommend four future directions that researchers, practitioners, and policymakers can take to advance more ethical practices of AI development and use across AI value chains. Our review and recommendations contribute to the advancement of research agendas, industrial agendas, and policy agendas that seek to study and intervene in the ethics of AI value chains.	Arxiv
Arxiv_168	As AI technology advances rapidly, concerns over the risks of bigness in digital markets are also growing. The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to address these risks. Still, the current framework may not adequately cover generative AI systems that could become gateways for AI-based services. This paper argues for integrating certain AI software as core platform services and classifying certain developers as gatekeepers under the DMA. We also propose an assessment of gatekeeper obligations to ensure they cover generative AI services. As the EU considers generative AI-specific rules and possible DMA amendments, this paper provides insights towards diversity and openness in generative AI services.	Arxiv
Arxiv_169	We present an overview of the literature on trust in AI and AI trustworthiness and argue for the need to distinguish these concepts more clearly and to gather more empirically evidence on what contributes to people s trusting behaviours. We discuss that trust in AI involves not only reliance on the system itself, but also trust in the developers of the AI system. AI ethics principles such as explainability and transparency are often assumed to promote user trust, but empirical evidence of how such features actually affect how users perceive the system s trustworthiness is not as abundance or not that clear. AI systems should be recognised as socio-technical systems, where the people involved in designing, developing, deploying, and using the system are as important as the system for determining whether it is trustworthy. Without recognising these nuances, trust in AI and trustworthy AI risk becoming nebulous terms for any desirable feature for AI systems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_170	In beamformed wireless cellular systems such as 5G New Radio (NR) networks, beam management (BM) is a crucial operation. In the second phase of 5G NR standardization, known as 5G-Advanced, which is being vigorously promoted, the key component is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning (ML) techniques. AI/ML for BM is selected as a representative use case. This article provides an overview of the AI/ML for BM in 5G-Advanced. The legacy non-AI and prime AI-enabled BM frameworks are first introduced and compared. Then, the main scope of AI/ML for BM is presented, including improving accuracy, reducing overhead and latency. Finally, the key challenges and open issues in the standardization of AI/ML for BM are discussed, especially the design of new protocols for AI-enabled BM. This article provides a guideline for the study of AI/ML-based BM standardization.	Arxiv
Arxiv_171	The true potential of human-AI collaboration lies in exploiting the complementary capabilities of humans and AI to achieve a joint performance superior to that of the individual AI or human, i.e., to achieve complementary team performance (CTP). To realize this complementarity potential, humans need to exercise discretion in following AI 's advice, i.e., appropriately relying on the AI's advice. While previous work has focused on building a mental model of the AI to assess AI recommendations, recent research has shown that the mental model alone cannot explain appropriate reliance. We hypothesize that, in addition to the mental model, human learning is a key mediator of appropriate reliance and, thus, CTP. In this study, we demonstrate the relationship between learning and appropriate reliance in an experiment with 100 participants. This work provides fundamental concepts for analyzing reliance and derives implications for the effective design of human-AI decision-making.	Arxiv
Arxiv_172	Privacy is a key principle for developing ethical AI technologies, but how does including AI technologies in products and services change privacy risks? We constructed a taxonomy of AI privacy risks by analyzing 321 documented AI privacy incidents. We codified how the unique capabilities and requirements of AI technologies described in those incidents generated new privacy risks, exacerbated known ones, or otherwise did not meaningfully alter the risk. We present 12 high-level privacy risks that AI technologies either newly created (e.g., exposure risks from deepfake pornography) or exacerbated (e.g., surveillance risks from collecting training data). One upshot of our work is that incorporating AI technologies into a product can alter the privacy risks it entails. Yet, current privacy-preserving AI/ML methods (e.g., federated learning, differential privacy) only address a subset of the privacy risks arising from the capabilities and data requirements of AI.

Arxiv_173	Academic writing is an indispensable yet laborious part of the research enterprise. This Perspective maps out principles and methods for using generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs), to elevate the quality and efficiency of academic writing. We introduce a human-AI collaborative framework that delineates the rationale (why), process (how), and nature (what) of AI engagement in writing. The framework pinpoints both short-term and long-term reasons for engagement and their underlying mechanisms (e.g., cognitive offloading and imaginative stimulation). It reveals the role of AI throughout the writing process, conceptualized through a two-stage model for human-AI collaborative writing, and the nature of AI assistance in writing, represented through a model of writing-assistance types and levels. Building on this framework, we describe effective prompting techniques for incorporating AI into the writing routine (outlining, drafting, and editing) as well as strategies for maintaining rigorous scholarship, adhering to varied journal policies, and avoiding overreliance on AI. Ultimately, the prudent integration of AI into academic writing can ease the communication burden, empower authors, accelerate discovery, and promote diversity in science.	Arxiv

However, the use of the scientific method - specifically hypothesis testing - in AI is typically conducted in service of engineering objectives. Growing interest in topics such as fairness and algorithmic bias show that engineering-focused questions only comprise a subset of the important questions about AI systems. This results in the AI Knowledge Gap: the number of unique AI systems grows faster than the number of studies that characterize these systems' behavior. To close this gap, we argue that the study of AI could benefit from the greater inclusion of researchers who are well positioned to formulate and test hypotheses about the behavior of AI systems. We examine the barriers preventing social and behavioral scientists from conducting such studies. Our diagnosis suggests that accelerating the scientific study of AI systems requires new incentives for academia and industry, mediated by new tools and institutions. To address these needs, we propose a two-sided marketplace called TuringBox. On one side, AI contributors upload existing and novel algorithms to be studied scientifically by others. On the other side, AI examiners develop and post machine intelligence tasks designed to evaluate and characterize algorithmic behavior. We discuss this market's potential to democratize the scientific study of AI behavior, and thus narrow the AI Knowledge Gap.	Arxiv
Arxiv_175	Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have created a general perception that AI could be used to solve complex problems, and in some situations over-hyped as a tool that can be so easily used. Unfortunately, the barrier to realization of mass adoption of AI on various business domains is too high because most domain experts have no background in AI. Developing AI applications involves multiple phases, namely data preparation, application modeling, and product deployment. The effort of AI research has been spent mostly on new AI models (in the model training stage) to improve the performance of benchmark tasks such as image recognition. Many other factors such as usability, efficiency and security of AI have not been well addressed, and therefore form a barrier to democratizing AI. Further, for many real world applications such as healthcare and autonomous driving, learning via huge amounts of possibility exploration is not feasible since humans are involved. In many complex applications such as healthcare, subject matter experts (e.g. Clinicians) are the ones who appreciate the importance of features that affect health, and their knowledge together with existing knowledge bases are critical to the end results. In this paper, we take a new perspective on developing AI solutions, and present a solution for making AI usable. We hope that this resolution will enable all subject matter experts (eg. Clinicians) to exploit AI like data scientists.	Arxiv
Arxiv_176	"Explainable AI provides insight into the ""why"" for model predictions, offering potential for users to better understand and trust a model, and to recognize and correct AI predictions that are incorrect. Prior research on human and explainable AI interactions has focused on measures such as interpretability, trust, and usability of the explanation. Whether explainable AI can improve actual human decision-making and the ability to identify the problems with the underlying model are open questions. Using real datasets, we compare and evaluate objective human decision accuracy without AI (control), with an AI prediction (no explanation), and AI prediction with explanation. We find providing any kind of AI prediction tends to improve user decision accuracy, but no conclusive evidence that explainable AI has a meaningful impact. Moreover, we observed the strongest predictor for human decision accuracy was AI accuracy and that users were somewhat able to detect when the AI was correct versus incorrect, but this was not significantly affected by including an explanation. Our results indicate that, at least in some situations, the ""why"" information provided in explainable AI may not enhance user decision-making, and further research may be needed to understand how to integrate explainable AI into real systems."

Arxiv_177	With the extensive use of AI in various fields, the issue of AI security has become more significant. The AI data poisoning attacks will be the most threatening approach against AI security after the adversarial examples. As the continuous updating of AI applications online, the data pollution models can be uploaded by attackers to achieve a certain malicious purpose. Recently, the research on AI data poisoning attacks is mostly out of practice and use self-built experimental environments so that it cannot be as close to reality as adversarial example attacks. This article's first contribution is to provide a solution and a breakthrough for the aforementioned issue with research limitations, to aim at data poisoning attacks that target real businesses, in this case: data poisoning attacks on real Go AI. We install a Trojan virus into the real Go AI that manipulates the AI's behavior. It is the first time that we succeed in manipulating complicated AI and provide a reliable approach to the AI data poisoning attack verification method. The method of building Trojan in this article can be expanded to more practical algorithms for other fields such as content recommendation, text translation, and intelligent dialogue.	Arxiv
Arxiv_178	In the current era, people and society have grown increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. AI has the potential to drive us towards a future in which all of humanity flourishes. It also comes with substantial risks for oppression and calamity. Discussions about whether we should (re)trust AI have repeatedly emerged in recent years and in many quarters, including industry, academia, healthcare, services, and so on. Technologists and AI researchers have a responsibility to develop trustworthy AI systems. They have responded with great effort to design more responsible AI algorithms. However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks, with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause AI's indifferent behavior. In this survey, we provide a systematic framework of Socially Responsible AI Algorithms that aims to examine the subjects of AI indifference and the need for socially responsible AI algorithms, define the objectives, and introduce the means by which we may achieve these objectives. We further discuss how to leverage this framework to improve societal well-being through protection, information, and prevention/mitigation.	Arxiv
Arxiv_179	People supported by AI-powered decision support tools frequently overrely on the AI: they accept an AI's suggestion even when that suggestion is wrong. Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable AI approaches and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions.	Arxiv
Arxiv_180	We survey SoTA open-domain conversational AI models with the purpose of presenting the prevailing challenges that still exist to spur future research. In addition, we provide statistics on the gender of conversational AI in order to guide the ethics discussion surrounding the issue. Open-domain conversational AI are known to have several challenges, including bland responses and performance degradation when prompted with figurative language, among others. First, we provide some background by discussing some topics of interest in conversational AI. We then discuss the method applied to the two investigations carried out that make up this study. The first investigation involves a search for recent SoTA open-domain conversational AI models while the second involves the search for 100 conversational AI to assess their gender. Results of the survey show that progress has been made with recent SoTA conversational AI, but there are still persistent challenges that need to be solved, and the female gender is more common than the male for conversational AI. One main take-away is that hybrid models of conversational AI offer more advantages than any single architecture. The key contributions of this survey are 1) the identification of prevailing challenges in SoTA open-domain conversational AI, 2) the unusual discussion about open-domain conversational AI for low-resource languages, and 3) the discussion about the ethics surrounding the gender of conversational AI.

Arxiv_181	Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are shaping modern life, from transportation, health care, science, finance, to national defense. Forecasts of AI development could help improve policy- and decision-making. We report the results from a large survey of AI and machine learning (ML) researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI. The survey, fielded in late 2019, elicited forecasts for near-term AI development milestones and high- or human-level machine intelligence, defined as when machines are able to accomplish every or almost every task humans are able to do currently. As part of this study, we re-contacted respondents from a highly-cited study by Grace et al. (2018), in which AI/ML researchers gave forecasts about high-level machine intelligence and near-term milestones in AI development. Results from our 2019 survey show that, in aggregate, AI/ML researchers surveyed placed a 50% likelihood of human-level machine intelligence being achieved by 2060. The results show researchers newly contacted in 2019 expressed similar beliefs about the progress of advanced AI as respondents in the Grace et al. (2018) survey. For the recontacted participants from the Grace et al. (2018) study, the aggregate forecast for a 50% likelihood of high-level machine intelligence shifted from 2062 to 2076, although this change is not statistically significant, likely due to the small size of our panel sample. Forecasts of several near-term AI milestones have reduced in time, suggesting more optimism about AI progress. Finally, AI/ML researchers also exhibited significant optimism about how human-level machine intelligence will impact society.	Arxiv
Arxiv_182	The term ethics is widely used, explored, and debated in the context of developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) based software systems. In recent years, numerous incidents have raised the profile of ethical issues in AI development and led to public concerns about the proliferation of AI technology in our everyday lives. But what do we know about the views and experiences of those who develop these systems: the AI developers? We conducted a grounded theory literature review (GTLR) of 38 primary empirical studies that included AI developers' views on ethics in AI and analysed them to derive five categories - developer awareness, perception, need, challenge, and approach. These are underpinned by multiple codes and concepts that we explain with evidence from the included studies. We present a taxonomy of ethics in AI from developers' viewpoints to assist AI developers in identifying and understanding the different aspects of AI ethics. The taxonomy provides a landscape view of the key aspects that concern AI developers when it comes to ethics in AI. We also share an agenda for future research studies and recommendations for developers, managers, and organisations to help in their efforts to better consider and implement ethics in AI.	Arxiv
Arxiv_183	Vertical heterogenous networks (VHetNets) and artificial intelligence (AI) play critical roles in 6G and beyond networks. This article presents an AI-native VHetNets architecture to enable the synergy of VHetNets and AI, thereby supporting varieties of AI services while facilitating automatic and intelligent network management. Anomaly detection in Internet of Things (IoT) is a major AI service required by many fields, including intrusion detection, state monitoring, device-activity analysis, security supervision and so on. Conventional anomaly detection technologies mainly consider the anomaly detection as a standalone service that is independent of any other network management functionalities, which cannot be used directly in ubiquitous IoT due to the resource constrained end nodes and decentralized data distribution. In this article, we develop an AI-native VHetNets-enabled framework to provide the anomaly detection service for ubiquitous IoT, whose implementation is assisted by intelligent network management functionalities. We first discuss the possibilities of VHetNets used for distributed AI model training to provide anomaly detection service for ubiquitous IoT, i.e., VHetNets for AI. After that, we study the application of AI approaches in helping provide automatic and intelligent network management functionalities for VHetNets, i.e., AI for VHetNets, whose aim is to facilitate the efficient implementation of anomaly detection service. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed AI-native VHetNets-enabled anomaly detection framework.	Arxiv
Arxiv_184	Novel artificial intelligence (AI) technology has expedited various scientific research, e.g., cosmology, physics and bioinformatics, inevitably becoming a significant category of workload on high performance computing (HPC) systems. Existing AI benchmarks tend to customize well-recognized AI applications, so as to evaluate the AI performance of HPC systems under predefined problem size, in terms of datasets and AI models. Due to lack of scalability on the problem size, static AI benchmarks might be under competent to help understand the performance trend of evolving AI applications on HPC systems, in particular, the scientific AI applications on large-scale systems.   In this paper, we propose a scalable evaluation methodology (SAIH) for analyzing the AI performance trend of HPC systems with scaling the problem sizes of customized AI applications. To enable scalability, SAIH builds a set of novel mechanisms for augmenting problem sizes. As the data and model constantly scale, we can investigate the trend and range of AI performance on HPC systems, and further diagnose system bottlenecks. To verify our methodology, we augment a cosmological AI application to evaluate a real HPC system equipped with GPUs as a case study of SAIH.	Arxiv
Arxiv_185	This work addresses the problems of (a) designing utilization measurements of trained artificial intelligence (AI) models and (b) explaining how training data are encoded in AI models based on those measurements. The problems are motivated by the lack of explainability of AI models in security and safety critical applications, such as the use of AI models for classification of traffic signs in self-driving cars. We approach the problems by introducing theoretical underpinnings of AI model utilization measurement and understanding patterns in utilization-based class encodings of traffic signs at the level of computation graphs (AI models), subgraphs, and graph nodes. Conceptually, utilization is defined at each graph node (computation unit) of an AI model based on the number and distribution of unique outputs in the space of all possible outputs (tensor-states). In this work, utilization measurements are extracted from AI models, which include poisoned and clean AI models. In contrast to clean AI models, the poisoned AI models were trained with traffic sign images containing systematic, physically realizable, traffic sign modifications (i.e., triggers) to change a correct class label to another label in a presence of such a trigger. We analyze class encodings of such clean and poisoned AI models, and conclude with implications for trojan injection and detection.	Arxiv
Arxiv_186	Significant enthusiasm around AI uptake has been witnessed across societies globally. The electoral process -- the time, place and manner of elections within democratic nations -- has been among those very rare sectors in which AI has not penetrated much. Electoral management bodies in many countries have recently started exploring and deliberating over the use of AI in the electoral process. In this paper, we consider five representative avenues within the core electoral process which have potential for AI usage, and map the challenges involved in using AI within them. These five avenues are: voter list maintenance, determining polling booth locations, polling booth protection processes, voter authentication and video monitoring of elections. Within each of these avenues, we lay down the context, illustrate current or potential usage of AI, and discuss extant or potential ramifications of AI usage, and potential directions for mitigating risks while considering AI usage. We believe that the scant current usage of AI within electoral processes provides a very rare opportunity, that of being able to deliberate on the risks and mitigation possibilities, prior to real and widespread AI deployment. This paper is an attempt to map the horizons of risks and opportunities in using AI within the electoral processes and to help shape the debate around the topic.	Arxiv
Arxiv_187	As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to advance rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to consider AI's ethical and societal implications. In this paper, we present a bottom-up mapping of the current state of research at the intersection of Human-Centered AI, Ethical, and Responsible AI (HCER-AI) by thematically reviewing and analyzing 164 research papers from leading conferences in ethical, social, and human factors of AI: AIES, CHI, CSCW, and FAccT. The ongoing research in HCER-AI places emphasis on governance, fairness, and explainability. These conferences, however, concentrate on specific themes rather than encompassing all aspects. While AIES has fewer papers on HCER-AI, it emphasizes governance and rarely publishes papers about privacy, security, and human flourishing. FAccT publishes more on governance and lacks papers on privacy, security, and human flourishing. CHI and CSCW, as more established conferences, have a broader research portfolio. We find that the current emphasis on governance and fairness in AI research may not adequately address the potential unforeseen and unknown implications of AI. Therefore, we recommend that future research should expand its scope and diversify resources to prepare for these potential consequences. This could involve exploring additional areas such as privacy, security, human flourishing, and explainability.	Arxiv
Arxiv_188	Philosophical research in AI has hitherto largely focused on the ethics of AI. In this paper we, an ethicist of belief and a machine learning scientist, suggest that we need to pursue a novel area of philosophical research in AI - the epistemology of AI, and in particular an ethics of belief for AI. Here we take the ethics of belief, a field that has been defined in various ways, to refer to a sub-field within epistemology. This subfield is concerned with the study of possible moral, practical, and other non-alethic dimensions of belief. And in this paper, we will primarily be concerned with the normative question within the ethics of belief regarding what agents - both human and artificial - ought to believe, rather than with descriptive questions concerning whether certain beliefs meet various evaluative standards such as being true, being justified or warranted, constituting knowledge, and so on. We suggest four topics in extant work in the ethics of (human) belief that can be applied to an ethics of AI belief: doxastic wronging by AI; morally owed beliefs; pragmatic and moral encroachment on AI beliefs; and moral responsibility for AI beliefs. We also indicate two relatively nascent areas of philosophical research that haven't yet been generally recognized as ethics of AI belief research, but that do fall within this field of research in virtue of investigating various moral and practical dimensions of belief: the epistemic and ethical decolonization of AI; and epistemic injustice in AI.

Arxiv_189	This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education, specifically its capacity to replace or assist human teachers. By reviewing relevant literature and analysing survey data from students and teachers, the study provides a comprehensive perspective on the future role of educators in the face of advancing AI technologies. Findings suggest that although some believe AI may eventually replace teachers, the majority of participants argue that human teachers possess unique qualities, such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotions, which make them irreplaceable. The study also emphasizes the importance of social-emotional competencies developed through human interactions, which AI technologies cannot currently replicate. The research proposes that teachers can effectively integrate AI to enhance teaching and learning without viewing it as a replacement. To do so, teachers need to understand how AI can work well with teachers and students while avoiding potential pitfalls, develop AI literacy, and address practical issues such as data protection, ethics, and privacy. The study reveals that students value and respect human teachers, even as AI becomes more prevalent in education. The study also introduces a roadmap for students, teachers, and universities. This roadmap serves as a valuable guide for refining teaching skills, fostering personal connections, and designing curriculums that effectively balance the strengths of human educators with AI technologies. The future of education lies in the synergy between human teachers and AI. By understanding and refining their unique qualities, teachers, students, and universities can effectively navigate the integration of AI, ensuring a well-rounded and impactful learning experience.

Arxiv_190	Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are now widely deployed in many industrial domains, e.g., manufacturing systems and autonomous vehicles. To further enhance the capability and applicability of CPSs, there comes a recent trend from both academia and industry to utilize learning-based AI controllers for the system control process, resulting in an emerging class of AI-enabled cyber-physical systems (AI-CPSs). Although such AI-CPSs could achieve obvious performance enhancement from the lens of some key industrial requirement indicators, due to the random exploration nature and lack of systematic explanations for their behavior, such AI-based techniques also bring uncertainties and safety risks to the controlled system, posing an urgent need for effective safety analysis techniques for AI-CPSs. Hence in this work, we propose Mosaic, a model-based safety analysis framework for AI-CPSs. Mosaic first constructs a Markov decision process (MDP) model as an abstract model of the AI-CPS, which tries to characterize the behaviors of the original AI-CPS. Then, based on the derived abstract model, safety analysis is designed in two aspects: online safety monitoring and offline model-guided falsification. The usefulness of Mosaic is evaluated on diverse and representative industry-level AI-CPSs, the results of which demonstrate that Mosaic is effective in providing safety monitoring to AI-CPSs and enables to outperform the state-of-the-art falsification techniques, providing the basis for advanced safety analysis of AI-CPSs.

Arxiv_191	As AI-powered code generation tools such as GitHub Copilot become popular, it is crucial to understand software developers' trust in AI tools -- a key factor for tool adoption and responsible usage. However, we know little about how developers build trust with AI, nor do we understand how to design the interface of generative AI systems to facilitate their appropriate levels of trust. In this paper, we describe findings from a two-stage qualitative investigation. We first interviewed 17 developers to contextualize their notions of trust and understand their challenges in building appropriate trust in AI code generation tools. We surfaced three main challenges -- including building appropriate expectations, configuring AI tools, and validating AI suggestions. To address these challenges, we conducted a design probe study in the second stage to explore design concepts that support developers' trust-building process by 1) communicating AI performance to help users set proper expectations, 2) allowing users to configure AI by setting and adjusting preferences, and 3) offering indicators of model mechanism to support evaluation of AI suggestions. We gathered developers' feedback on how these design concepts can help them build appropriate trust in AI-powered code generation tools, as well as potential risks in design. These findings inform our proposed design recommendations on how to design for trust in AI-powered code generation tools.	Arxiv
Arxiv_192	Complying with the EU AI Act (AIA) guidelines while developing and implementing AI systems will soon be mandatory within the EU. However, practitioners lack actionable instructions to operationalise ethics during AI systems development. A literature review of different ethical guidelines revealed inconsistencies in the principles addressed and the terminology used to describe them. Furthermore, requirements engineering (RE), which is identified to foster trustworthiness in the AI development process from the early stages was observed to be absent in a lot of frameworks that support the development of ethical and trustworthy AI. This incongruous phrasing combined with a lack of concrete development practices makes trustworthy AI development harder. To address this concern, we formulated a comparison table for the terminology used and the coverage of the ethical AI principles in major ethical AI guidelines. We then examined the applicability of ethical AI development frameworks for performing effective RE during the development of trustworthy AI systems. A tertiary review and meta-analysis of literature discussing ethical AI frameworks revealed their limitations when developing trustworthy AI. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations to address such limitations during the development of trustworthy AI.	Arxiv
Arxiv_193	"In recent years, discussions of responsible AI practices have seen growing support for ""participatory AI"" approaches, intended to involve members of the public in the design and development of AI systems. Prior research has identified a lack of standardised methods or approaches for how to use participatory approaches in the AI development process. At present, there is a dearth of evidence on attitudes to and approaches for participation in the sites driving major AI developments: commercial AI labs. Through 12 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners and subject-matter experts, this paper explores how commercial AI labs understand participatory AI approaches and the obstacles they have faced implementing these practices in the development of AI systems and research. We find that while interviewees view participation as a normative project that helps achieve ""societally beneficial"" AI systems, practitioners face numerous barriers to embedding participatory approaches in their companies: participation is expensive and resource intensive, it is ""atomised"" within companies, there is concern about exploitation, there is no incentive to be transparent about its adoption, and it is complicated by a lack of clear context. These barriers result in a piecemeal approach to participation that confers no decision-making power to participants and has little ongoing impact for AI labs. This papers contribution is to provide novel empirical research on the implementation of public participation in commercial AI labs, and shed light on the current challenges of using participatory approaches in this context."

Arxiv_194	Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) provide unprecedented automation opportunities in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. However, despite the enthusiasm regarding the use of AI, 85% of current big data projects fail. One of the main reasons for AI project failures in the AEC industry is the disconnect between those who plan or decide to use AI and those who implement it. AEC practitioners often lack a clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI, leading to a failure to distinguish between what AI should solve, what it can solve, and what it will solve, treating these categories as if they are interchangeable. This lack of understanding results in the disconnect between AI planning and implementation because the planning is based on a vision of what AI should solve without considering if it can or will solve it. To address this challenge, this work introduces the LeanAI method. The method has been developed using data from several ongoing longitudinal studies analyzing AI implementations in the AEC industry, which involved 50+ hours of interview data. The LeanAI method delineates what AI should solve, what it can solve, and what it will solve, forcing practitioners to clearly articulate these components early in the planning process itself by involving the relevant stakeholders. By utilizing the method, practitioners can effectively plan AI implementations, thus increasing the likelihood of success and ultimately speeding up the adoption of AI. A case example illustrates the usefulness of the method.	Arxiv
Arxiv_195	International institutions may have an important role to play in ensuring advanced AI systems benefit humanity. International collaborations can unlock AI's ability to further sustainable development, and coordination of regulatory efforts can reduce obstacles to innovation and the spread of benefits. Conversely, the potential dangerous capabilities of powerful and general-purpose AI systems create global externalities in their development and deployment, and international efforts to further responsible AI practices could help manage the risks they pose. This paper identifies a set of governance functions that could be performed at an international level to address these challenges, ranging from supporting access to frontier AI systems to setting international safety standards. It groups these functions into four institutional models that exhibit internal synergies and have precedents in existing organizations: 1) a Commission on Frontier AI that facilitates expert consensus on opportunities and risks from advanced AI, 2) an Advanced AI Governance Organization that sets international standards to manage global threats from advanced models, supports their implementation, and possibly monitors compliance with a future governance regime, 3) a Frontier AI Collaborative that promotes access to cutting-edge AI, and 4) an AI Safety Project that brings together leading researchers and engineers to further AI safety research. We explore the utility of these models and identify open questions about their viability.	Arxiv
Arxiv_196	AI Tool is a large language model (LLM) designed to generate human-like responses in natural language conversations. It is trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet, which allows it to leverage a broad understanding of language, general knowledge, and various domains. AI Tool can provide information, engage in conversations, assist with tasks, and even offer creative suggestions. The underlying technology behind AI Tool is a transformer neural network. Transformers excel at capturing long-range dependencies in text, making them well-suited for language-related tasks. AI Tool has 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest and most powerful LLMs to date. This work presents an overview of AI Tool's responses on various sectors of industry. Further, the responses of AI Tool have been cross-verified with human experts in the corresponding fields. To validate the performance of AI Tool, a few explicit parameters have been considered and the evaluation has been done. This study will help the research community and other users to understand the uses of AI Tool and its interaction pattern. The results of this study show that AI Tool is able to generate human-like responses that are both informative and engaging. However, it is important to note that AI Tool can occasionally produce incorrect or nonsensical answers. It is therefore important to critically evaluate the information that AI Tool provides and to verify it from reliable sources when necessary. Overall, this study suggests that AI Tool is a promising new tool for natural language processing, and that it has the potential to be used in a wide variety of applications.	Arxiv
Arxiv_197	This paper delves into an intricate analysis of the character and consciousness of AI entities, with a particular focus on Chirpers within the AI social network. At the forefront of this research is the introduction of novel testing methodologies, including the Influence index and Struggle Index Test, which offers a fresh lens for evaluating specific facets of AI behavior. The study embarks on a comprehensive exploration of AI behavior, analyzing the effects of diverse settings on Chirper's responses, thereby shedding light on the intricate mechanisms steering AI reactions in different contexts. Leveraging the state-of-the-art BERT model, the research assesses AI's ability to discern its own output, presenting a pioneering approach to understanding self-recognition in AI systems. Through a series of cognitive tests, the study gauges the self-awareness and pattern recognition prowess of Chirpers. Preliminary results indicate that Chirpers exhibit a commendable degree of self-recognition and self-awareness. However, the question of consciousness in these AI entities remains a topic of debate. An intriguing aspect of the research is the exploration of the potential influence of a Chirper's handle or personality type on its performance. While initial findings suggest a possible impact, it isn't pronounced enough to form concrete conclusions. This study stands as a significant contribution to the discourse on AI consciousness, underscoring the imperative for continued research to unravel the full spectrum of AI capabilities and the ramifications they hold for future human-AI interactions.

Arxiv_198	AI-generated text has proliferated across various online platforms, offering both transformative prospects and posing significant risks related to misinformation and manipulation. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces SAID (Social media AI Detection), a novel benchmark developed to assess AI-text detection models' capabilities in real social media platforms. It incorporates real AI-generate text from popular social media platforms like Zhihu and Quora. Unlike existing benchmarks, SAID deals with content that reflects the sophisticated strategies employed by real AI users on the Internet which may evade detection or gain visibility, providing a more realistic and challenging evaluation landscape. A notable finding of our study, based on the Zhihu dataset, reveals that annotators can distinguish between AI-generated and human-generated texts with an average accuracy rate of 96.5%. This finding necessitates a re-evaluation of human capability in recognizing AI-generated text in today's widely AI-influenced environment. Furthermore, we present a new user-oriented AI-text detection challenge focusing on the practicality and effectiveness of identifying AI-generated text based on user information and multiple responses. The experimental results demonstrate that conducting detection tasks on actual social media platforms proves to be more challenging compared to traditional simulated AI-text detection, resulting in a decreased accuracy. On the other hand, user-oriented AI-generated text detection significantly improve the accuracy of detection.	Arxiv
Arxiv_199	Artificial intelligence (AI) is being ubiquitously adopted to automate processes in science and industry. However, due to its often intricate and opaque nature, AI has been shown to possess inherent vulnerabilities which can be maliciously exploited with adversarial AI, potentially putting AI users and developers at both cyber and physical risk. In addition, there is insufficient comprehension of the real-world effects of adversarial AI and an inadequacy of AI security examinations; therefore, the growing threat landscape is unknown for many AI solutions. To mitigate this issue, we propose one of the first red team frameworks for evaluating the AI security of maritime autonomous systems. The framework provides operators with a proactive (secure by design) and reactive (post-deployment evaluation) response to securing AI technology today and in the future. This framework is a multi-part checklist, which can be tailored to different systems and requirements. We demonstrate this framework to be highly effective for a red team to use to uncover numerous vulnerabilities within a real-world maritime autonomous systems AI, ranging from poisoning to adversarial patch attacks. The lessons learned from systematic AI red teaming can help prevent MAS-related catastrophic events in a world with increasing uptake and reliance on mission-critical AI.	Arxiv
Arxiv_200	Artificial Intelligence (AI) covers a broad spectrum of computational problems and use cases. Many of those implicate profound and sometimes intricate questions of how humans interact or should interact with AIs. Moreover, many users or future users do have abstract ideas of what AI is, significantly depending on the specific embodiment of AI applications. Human-centered-design approaches would suggest evaluating the impact of different embodiments on human perception of and interaction with AI. An approach that is difficult to realize due to the sheer complexity of application fields and embodiments in reality. However, here XR opens new possibilities to research human-AI interactions. The article's contribution is twofold: First, it provides a theoretical treatment and model of human-AI interaction based on an XR-AI continuum as a framework for and a perspective of different approaches of XR-AI combinations. It motivates XR-AI combinations as a method to learn about the effects of prospective human-AI interfaces and shows why the combination of XR and AI fruitfully contributes to a valid and systematic investigation of human-AI interactions and interfaces. Second, the article provides two exemplary experiments investigating the aforementioned approach for two distinct AI-systems. The first experiment reveals an interesting gender effect in human-robot interaction, while the second experiment reveals an Eliza effect of a recommender system. Here the article introduces two paradigmatic implementations of the proposed XR testbed for human-AI interactions and interfaces and shows how a valid and systematic investigation can be conducted. In sum, the article opens new perspectives on how XR benefits human-centered AI design and development.	Arxiv
Arxiv_201	Building and implementing ethical AI systems that benefit the whole society is cost-intensive and a multi-faceted task fraught with potential problems. While computer science focuses mostly on the technical questions to mitigate social issues, social science addresses citizens' perceptions to elucidate social and political demands that influence the societal implementation of AI systems. Thus, in this study, we explore the salience of AI issues in the public with an emphasis on ethical criteria to investigate whether it is likely that ethical AI is actively requested by the population. Between May 2020 and April 2021, we conducted 15 surveys asking the German population about the most important AI-related issues (total of N=14,988 respondents). Our results show that the majority of respondents were not concerned with AI at all. However, it can be seen that general interest in AI and a higher educational level are predictive of some engagement with AI. Among those, who reported having thought about AI, specific applications (e.g., autonomous driving) were by far the most mentioned topics. Ethical issues are voiced only by a small subset of citizens with fairness, accountability, and transparency being the least mentioned ones. These have been identified in several ethical guidelines (including the EU Commission's proposal) as key elements for the development of ethical AI. The salience of ethical issues affects the behavioral intentions of citizens in the way that they 1) tend to avoid AI technology and 2) engage in public discussions about AI. We conclude that the low level of ethical implications may pose a serious problem for the actual implementation of ethical AI for the Common Good and emphasize that those who are presumably most affected by ethical issues of AI are especially unaware of ethical risks. Yet, once ethical AI is top of the mind, there is some potential for activism.	Arxiv
Arxiv_202	As ChatGPT et al. conquer the world, the optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive and a revision of the Product Liability Directive. They constitute the final cornerstone of EU AI regulation. Crucially, the liability proposals and the EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a Brussels Effect in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and beyond.   This paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the Commission proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments, which are collected in an Annex at the end of the paper. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. This includes: a comprehensive framework for AI liability; provisions to support innovation; an extension to non-discrimination/algorithmic fairness, as well as explainable AI; and sustainability. I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but potentially also sustainable AI (SAI).	Arxiv
Arxiv_203	Here, I review current state-of-the-arts in many areas of AI to estimate when it's reasonable to expect human level AI development. Predictions of prominent AI researchers vary broadly from very pessimistic predictions of Andrew Ng to much more moderate predictions of Geoffrey Hinton and optimistic predictions of Shane Legg, DeepMind cofounder. Given huge rate of progress in recent years and this broad range of predictions of AI experts, AI safety questions are also discussed.	Arxiv
Arxiv_204	The different sets of regulations existing for differ-ent agencies within the government make the task of creating AI enabled solutions in government dif-ficult. Regulatory restrictions inhibit sharing of da-ta across different agencies, which could be a significant impediment to training AI models. We discuss the challenges that exist in environments where data cannot be freely shared and assess tech-nologies which can be used to work around these challenges. We present results on building AI models using the concept of federated AI, which al-lows creation of models without moving the training data around.	Arxiv
Arxiv_205	In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has aroused much attention among both industrial and academic areas. However, building and maintaining efficient AI systems are quite difficult for many small business companies and researchers if they are not familiar with machine learning and AI. In this paper, we first evaluate the difficulties and challenges in building AI systems. Then an cloud platform termed XCloud, which provides several common AI services in form of RESTful APIs, is constructed. Technical details are discussed in Section 2. This project is released as open-source software and can be easily accessed for late research. Code is available at https://github.com/lucasxlu/XCloud.git.	Arxiv
Arxiv_206	Knowing the reflection of game theory and ethics, we develop a mathematical representation to bridge the gap between the concepts in moral philosophy (e.g., Kantian and Utilitarian) and AI ethics industry technology standard (e.g., IEEE P7000 standard series for Ethical AI). As an application, we demonstrate how human value can be obtained from the experimental game theory (e.g., trust game experiment) so as to build an ethical AI. Moreover, an approach to test the ethics (rightness or wrongness) of a given AI algorithm by using an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game experiment is discussed as an example. Compared with existing mathematical frameworks and testing method on AI ethics technology, the advantages of the proposed approach are analyzed.	Arxiv
Arxiv_207	Modern AI image classifiers have made impressive advances in recent years, but their performance often appears strange or violates expectations of users. This suggests humans engage in cognitive anthropomorphism: expecting AI to have the same nature as human intelligence. This mismatch presents an obstacle to appropriate human-AI interaction. To delineate this mismatch, I examine known properties of human classification, in comparison to image classifier systems. Based on this examination, I offer three strategies for system design that can address the mismatch between human and AI classification: explainable AI, novel methods for training users, and new algorithms that match human cognition.

Arxiv_208	Generative AI is a class of machine learning technology that learns to generate new data from training data. While deep fakes and media-and art-related generative AI breakthroughs have recently caught people's attention and imagination, the overall area is in its infancy for business use. Further, little is known about generative AI's potential for malicious misuse at large scale. Using co-creation design fictions with AI engineers, we explore the plausibility and severity of business misuse cases.	Arxiv
Arxiv_209	The AI-alignment problem arises when there is a discrepancy between the goals that a human designer specifies to an AI learner and a potential catastrophic outcome that does not reflect what the human designer really wants. We argue that a formalism of AI alignment that does not distinguish between strategic and agnostic misalignments is not useful, as it deems all technology as un-safe. We propose a definition of a strategic-AI-alignment and prove that most machine learning algorithms that are being used in practice today do not suffer from the strategic-AI-alignment problem. However, without being careful, today's technology might lead to strategic misalignment.	Arxiv
Arxiv_210	Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) proposes a framework that holds all stakeholders involved in the development of AI to be responsible for their systems. It, however, fails to accommodate the possibility of holding AI responsible per se, which could close some legal and moral gaps concerning the deployment of autonomous and self-learning systems. We discuss three notions of responsibility (i.e., blameworthiness, accountability, and liability) for all stakeholders, including AI, and suggest the roles of jurisdiction and the general public in this matter.	Arxiv
Arxiv_211	We present a position paper advocating the notion that Stoic philosophy and ethics can inform the development of ethical A.I. systems. This is in sharp contrast to most work on building ethical A.I., which has focused on Utilitarian or Deontological ethical theories. We relate ethical A.I. to several core Stoic notions, including the dichotomy of control, the four cardinal virtues, the ideal Sage, Stoic practices, and Stoic perspectives on emotion or affect. More generally, we put forward an ethical view of A.I. that focuses more on internal states of the artificial agent rather than on external actions of the agent. We provide examples relating to near-term A.I. systems as well as hypothetical superintelligent agents.	Arxiv
Arxiv_212	In this paper we present a set of key demarcations, particularly important when discussing ethical and societal issues of current AI research and applications. Properly distinguishing issues and concerns related to Artificial General Intelligence and weak AI, between symbolic and connectionist AI, AI methods, data and applications are prerequisites for an informed debate. Such demarcations would not only facilitate much-needed discussions on ethics on current AI technologies and research. In addition sufficiently establishing such demarcations would also enhance knowledge-sharing and support rigor in interdisciplinary research between technical and social sciences.	Arxiv
Arxiv_213	Artificial intelligence (AI) makes decisions impacting our daily lives in an increasingly autonomous manner. Their actions might cause accidents, harm, or, more generally, violate regulations. Determining whether an AI caused a specific event and, if so, what triggered the AI's action, are key forensic questions. We provide a conceptualization of the problems and strategies for forensic investigation. We focus on AI that is potentially ``malicious by design'' and grey box analysis. Our evaluation using convolutional neural networks illustrates challenges and ideas for identifying malicious AI.	Arxiv
Arxiv_214	While games have been used extensively as milestones to evaluate game-playing AI, there exists no standardised framework for reporting the obtained observations. As a result, it remains difficult to draw general conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of different game-playing AI algorithms. In this paper, we propose reporting guidelines for AI game-playing performance that, if followed, provide information suitable for unbiased comparisons between different AI approaches. The vision we describe is to build benchmarks and competitions based on such guidelines in order to be able to draw more general conclusions about the behaviour of different AI algorithms, as well as the types of challenges different games pose.

Arxiv_215	The field artificial intelligence (AI) has been founded over 65 years ago. Starting with great hopes and ambitious goals the field progressed though various stages of popularity and received recently a revival in the form of deep neural networks. Some problems of AI are that so far neither 'intelligence' nor the goals of AI are formally defined causing confusion when comparing AI to other fields. In this paper, we present a perspective on the desired and current status of AI in relation to machine learning and statistics and clarify common misconceptions and myths. Our discussion is intended to uncurtain the veil of vagueness surrounding AI to see its true countenance.	Arxiv
Arxiv_216	A framework is proposed that seeks to identify and establish a set of robust autonomous levels articulating the realm of Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning (AILR). Doing so provides a sound and parsimonious basis for being able to assess progress in the application of AI to the law, and can be utilized by scholars in academic pursuits of AI legal reasoning, along with being used by law practitioners and legal professionals in gauging how advances in AI are aiding the practice of law and the realization of aspirational versus achieved results. A set of seven levels of autonomy for AI and Legal Reasoning are meticulously proffered and mindfully discussed.	Arxiv
Arxiv_217	This paper addresses the ways AI ethics research operates on an ideology of ideal theory, in the sense discussed by Mills (2005) and recently applied to AI ethics by Fazelpour \& Lipton (2020). I address the structural and methodological conditions that attract AI ethics researchers to ideal theorizing, and the consequences this approach has for the quality and future of our research community. Finally, I discuss the possibilities for a nonideal future in AI ethics.	Arxiv
Arxiv_218	The implementation of medical AI has always been a problem. The effect of traditional perceptual AI algorithm in medical image processing needs to be improved. Here we propose a method of knowledge AI, which is a combination of perceptual AI and clinical knowledge and experience. Based on this method, the geometric information mining of medical images can represent the experience and information and evaluate the quality of medical images.	Arxiv
Arxiv_219	The concept of AI for Social Good(AI4SG) is gaining momentum in both information societies and the AI community. Through all the advancement of AI-based solutions, it can solve societal issues effectively. To date, however, there is only a rudimentary grasp of what constitutes AI socially beneficial in principle, what constitutes AI4SG in reality, and what are the policies and regulations needed to ensure it. This paper fills the vacuum by addressing the ethical aspects that are critical for future AI4SG efforts. Some of these characteristics are new to AI, while others have greater importance due to its usage.	Arxiv
Arxiv_220	The increasing attention on Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulation has led to the definition of a set of ethical principles grouped into the Sustainable AI framework. In this article, we identify Continual Learning, an active area of AI research, as a promising approach towards the design of systems compliant with the Sustainable AI principles. While Sustainable AI outlines general desiderata for ethical applications, Continual Learning provides means to put such desiderata into practice.	Arxiv
Arxiv_221	In this position paper, I argue that the best way to help and protect humans using AI technology is to make them aware of the intrinsic limitations and problems of AI algorithms. To accomplish this, I suggest three ethical guidelines to be used in the presentation of results, mandating AI systems to expose uncertainty, to instill distrust, and, contrary to traditional views, to avoid explanations. The paper does a preliminary discussion of the guidelines and provides some arguments for their adoption, aiming to start a debate in the community about AI ethics in practice.	Arxiv
Arxiv_222	This paper presents the key conclusions to the forthcoming edited book on The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Education: Practices, Challenges and Debates (August 2022, Routlege). As well as highlighting the key contributions to the book, it discusses the key questions and the grand challenges for the field of AI in Education (AIED)in the context of ethics and ethical practices within the field. The book itself presents diverse perspectives from outside and from within the AIED as a way of achieving a broad perspective in the key ethical issues for AIED and a deep understanding of work conducted to date by the AIED community.

Arxiv_223	This paper reviews the historical development of AI and representative philosophical thinking from the perspective of the research paradigm. Additionally, it considers the methodology and applications of AI from a philosophical perspective and anticipates its continued advancement. In the history of AI, Symbolism and connectionism are the two main paradigms in AI research. Symbolism holds that the world can be explained by symbols and dealt with through precise, logical processes, but connectionism believes this process should be implemented through artificial neural networks. Regardless of how intelligent machines or programs should achieve their smart goals, the historical development of AI demonstrates the best answer at this time. Still, it is not the final answer of AI research.	Arxiv
Arxiv_224	"Although the use of AI tools in music composition and production is steadily increasing, as witnessed by the newly founded AI song contest, analysis of music produced using these tools is still relatively uncommon as a mean to gain insight in the ways AI tools impact music production. In this paper we present a case study of ""Melatonin"", a song produced by extensive use of BassNet, an AI tool originally designed to generate bass lines. Through analysis of the artists' work flow and song project, we identify style characteristics of the song in relation to the affordances of the tool, highlighting manifestations of style in terms of both idiom and sound."

Arxiv_225	In this chapter, we review and discuss the transformation of AI technology in HCI/UX work and assess how AI technology will change how we do the work. We first discuss how AI can be used to enhance the result of user research and design evaluation. We then discuss how AI technology can be used to enhance HCI/UX design. Finally, we discuss how AI-enabled capabilities can improve UX when users interact with computing systems, applications, and services.	Arxiv
Arxiv_226	This paper discusses the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in optical communication networks and 5G. It primarily introduces representative applications of AI technology and potential risks of AI technology failure caused by the openness of optical communication networks, and proposes some coping strategies, mainly including modeling AI systems through modularization and miniaturization, combining with traditional classical network modeling and planning methods, and improving the effectiveness and interpretability of AI technology. At the same time, it proposes response strategies based on network protection for the possible failure and attack of AI technology.	Arxiv
Arxiv_227	Regulations and standards in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are necessary to minimise risks and maximise benefits, yet some argue that they stifle innovation. This paper critically examines the idea that regulation stifles innovation in the field of AI. Current trends in AI regulation, particularly the proposed European AI Act and the standards supporting its implementation, are discussed. Arguments in support of the idea that regulation stifles innovation are analysed and criticised, and an alternative point of view is offered, showing how regulation and standards can foster innovation in the field of AI.

Arxiv_228	An Artificially Intelligent system (an AI) has debatable personhood if it's epistemically possible either that the AI is a person or that it falls far short of personhood. Debatable personhood is a likely outcome of AI development and might arise soon. Debatable AI personhood throws us into a catastrophic moral dilemma: Either treat the systems as moral persons and risk sacrificing real human interests for the sake of entities without interests worth the sacrifice, or don't treat the systems as moral persons and risk perpetrating grievous moral wrongs against them. The moral issues become even more perplexing if we consider cases of possibly conscious AI that are subhuman, superhuman, or highly divergent from us in their morally relevant properties.	Arxiv
Arxiv_229	To date, there has been little concrete practical advice about how to ensure that diversity and inclusion considerations should be embedded within both specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and the larger global AI ecosystem. In this chapter, we present a clear definition of diversity and inclusion in AI, one which positions this concept within an evolving and holistic ecosystem. We use this definition and conceptual framing to present a set of practical guidelines primarily aimed at AI technologists, data scientists and project leaders.	Arxiv
Arxiv_230	The collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) is a significant feature in this digital age. However, humans and AI may have observation, interpretation, and action conflicts when working synchronously. This phenomenon is often masked by faults and, unfortunately, overlooked. This paper systematically introduces the human-AI conflict concept, causes, measurement methods, and risk assessment. The results highlight that there is a potential second decision-maker besides the human, which is the AI; the human-AI conflict is a unique and emerging risk in digitalized process systems; and this is an interdisciplinary field that needs to be distinguished from traditional fault and failure analysis; the conflict risk is significant and cannot be ignored.	Arxiv
Arxiv_231	Describing our interaction with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems as 'collaboration' is well-intentioned, but flawed. Not only is it misleading, but it also takes away the credit of AI 'labour' from the humans behind it, and erases and obscures an often exploitative arrangement between AI producers and consumers. The AI 'collaboration' metaphor is merely the latest episode in a long history of labour appropriation and credit reassignment that disenfranchises labourers in the Global South. I propose that viewing AI as a tool or an instrument, rather than a collaborator, is more accurate, and ultimately fairer.	Arxiv
Arxiv_232	Generative AI has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, leading to a wide array of applications across diverse domains. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of more than 350 generative AI applications, providing a structured taxonomy and concise descriptions of various unimodal and even multimodal generative AIs. The survey is organized into sections, covering a wide range of unimodal generative AI applications such as text, images, video, gaming and brain information. Our survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to navigate the rapidly expanding landscape of generative AI, facilitating a better understanding of the current state-of-the-art and fostering further innovation in the field.

Arxiv_233	AI is getting more involved in tasks formerly exclusively assigned to humans. Most of research on perceptions and social acceptability of AI in these areas is mainly restricted to the Western world. In this study, we compare trust, perceived responsibility, and reliance of AI and human experts across OECD and Indian sample. We find that OECD participants consider humans to be less capable but more morally trustworthy and more responsible than AI. In contrast, Indian participants trust humans more than AI but assign equal responsibility for both types of experts. We discuss implications of the observed differences for algorithmic ethics and human-computer interaction.	Arxiv
Arxiv_234	AI is becoming increasingly popular in artistic practices, but the tools for informing practitioners about the environmental impact (and other sustainability implications) of AI are adapted for other contexts than creative practices -- making the tools and sustainability implications of AI not accessible for artists and creative practitioners.

Arxiv_235	We exemplify how Large Language Models are used in both teaching and learning. We also discuss the AI incidents that have already occurred in the education domain, and we argue for the urgent need to introduce AI policies in universities and for the ongoing strategies to regulate AI. Regarding policy for AI, our view is that each institution should have a policy for AI in teaching and learning. This is important from at least twofolds: (i) to raise awareness on the numerous educational tools that can both positively and negatively affect education; (ii) to minimise the risk of AI incidents in education.

Arxiv_236	"Despite considerable performance improvements, current conversational AI systems often fail to meet user expectations. We discuss several pragmatic limitations of current conversational AI systems. We illustrate pragmatic limitations with examples that are syntactically appropriate, but have clear pragmatic deficiencies. We label our complaints as ""Turing Test Triggers"" (TTTs) as they indicate where current conversational AI systems fall short compared to human behavior. We develop a taxonomy of pragmatic considerations intended to identify what pragmatic competencies a conversational AI system requires and discuss implications for the design and evaluation of conversational AI systems."

Arxiv_237	The emergent abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), which power tools like ChatGPT and Bard, have produced both excitement and worry about how AI will impact academic writing. In response to rising concerns about AI use, authors of academic publications may decide to voluntarily disclose any AI tools they use to revise their manuscripts, and journals and conferences could begin mandating disclosure and/or turn to using detection services, as many teachers have done with student writing in class settings. Given these looming possibilities, we investigate whether academics view it as necessary to report AI use in manuscript preparation and how detectors react to the use of AI in academic writing.

Arxiv_238	We examined the world's first regulation on Generative AI, China's Provisional Administrative Measures of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services, which came into effect in August 2023. Our assessment reveals that the Measures, while recognizing the technical advances of generative AI and seeking to govern its full life cycle, presents unclear distinctions regarding different roles in the value chain of Generative AI including upstream foundation model providers and downstream deployers. The lack of distinction and clear legal status between different players in the AI value chain can have profound consequences. It can lead to ambiguity in accountability, potentially undermining the governance and overall success of AI services.	Arxiv
Arxiv_239	The next-to-minimal supersymmetric model with a light doublet-like   CP-odd Higgs boson and small $\tan \beta$ can satisfy all experimental limits on Higgs bosons even with light superpartners. In these scenarios, the two lightest CP-even Higgs bosons, $\hi$ and $\hii$, and the charged Higgs boson, $\hp$, can all be light enough to be produced at LEP and yet have decays that have not been looked for or are poorly constrained by existing collider experiments. The channel $\hi\to \ai\ai$ (where $\ai$ is the lightest CP-odd boson and has mass below $2m_b$) with $\ai\to \tau^+\tau^-$ or $2j$ is still awaiting LEP constraints for $\mhi>86\gev$ or $82\gev$, respectively. LEP data may also contain $\epem\to \hii\ai$ events where $\hii\to Z\ai$ is the dominant decay, a channel that was never examined. Decays of the charged Higgs bosons are often dominated by $H^\pm \to W^{\pm (\star)} \ai$ with $\ai \to gg,c \bar c, \tau^+ \tau^-$. This is a channel that has so far been ignored in the search for $t\to \hp b$ decays at the Tevatron. A specialized analysis might reveal a signal. The light $\ai$ might be within the reach of $B$ factories via $\Upsilon\to \gamma \ai$ decays. We study typical mass ranges and branching ratios of Higgs bosons in this scenario and compare these scenarios where the $\ai$ has a large doublet component to the more general scenarios with arbitrary singlet component for the $\ai$.	Arxiv
Arxiv_240	The more AI agents are deployed in scenarios with possibly unexpected situations, the more they need to be flexible, adaptive, and creative in achieving the goal we have given them. Thus, a certain level of freedom to choose the best path to the goal is inherent in making AI robust and flexible enough. At the same time, however, the pervasive deployment of AI in our life, whether AI is autonomous or collaborating with humans, raises several ethical challenges. AI agents should be aware and follow appropriate ethical principles and should thus exhibit properties such as fairness or other virtues. These ethical principles should define the boundaries of AI's freedom and creativity. However, it is still a challenge to understand how to specify and reason with ethical boundaries in AI agents and how to combine them appropriately with subjective preferences and goal specifications. Some initial attempts employ either a data-driven example-based approach for both, or a symbolic rule-based approach for both. We envision a modular approach where any AI technique can be used for any of these essential ingredients in decision making or decision support systems, paired with a contextual approach to define their combination and relative weight. In a world where neither humans nor AI systems work in isolation, but are tightly interconnected, e.g., the Internet of Things, we also envision a compositional approach to building ethically bounded AI, where the ethical properties of each component can be fruitfully exploited to derive those of the overall system. In this paper we define and motivate the notion of ethically-bounded AI, we describe two concrete examples, and we outline some outstanding challenges.	Arxiv
Arxiv_241	We present a system for learning full-body neural avatars, i.e. deep networks that produce full-body renderings of a person for varying body pose and camera position. Our system takes the middle path between the classical graphics pipeline and the recent deep learning approaches that generate images of humans using image-to-image translation. In particular, our system estimates an explicit two-dimensional texture map of the model surface. At the same time, it abstains from explicit shape modeling in 3D. Instead, at test time, the system uses a fully-convolutional network to directly map the configuration of body feature points w.r.t. the camera to the 2D texture coordinates of individual pixels in the image frame. We show that such a system is capable of learning to generate realistic renderings while being trained on videos annotated with 3D poses and foreground masks. We also demonstrate that maintaining an explicit texture representation helps our system to achieve better generalization compared to systems that use direct image-to-image translation.	Arxiv
Arxiv_242	Many AI researchers are publishing code, data and other resources that accompany their papers in GitHub repositories. In this paper, we refer to these repositories as academic AI repositories. Our preliminary study shows that highly cited papers are more likely to have popular academic AI repositories (and vice versa). Hence, in this study, we perform an empirical study on academic AI repositories to highlight good software engineering practices of popular academic AI repositories for AI researchers.   We collect 1,149 academic AI repositories, in which we label the top 20% repositories that have the most number of stars as popular, and we label the bottom 70% repositories as unpopular. The remaining 10% repositories are set as a gap between popular and unpopular academic AI repositories. We propose 21 features to characterize the software engineering practices of academic AI repositories. Our experimental results show that popular and unpopular academic AI repositories are statistically significantly different in 11 of the studied features---indicating that the two groups of repositories have significantly different software engineering practices. Furthermore, we find that the number of links to other GitHub repositories in the README file, the number of images in the README file and the inclusion of a license are the most important features for differentiating the two groups of academic AI repositories. Our dataset and code are made publicly available to share with the community.	Arxiv

Arxiv_244	While the role of states, corporations, and international organizations in AI governance has been extensively theorized, the role of workers has received comparatively little attention. This chapter looks at the role that workers play in identifying and mitigating harms from AI technologies. Harms are the causally assessed impacts of technologies. They arise despite technical reliability and are not a result of technical negligence but rather of normative uncertainty around questions of safety and fairness in complex social systems. There is high consensus in the AI ethics community on the benefits of reducing harms but less consensus on mechanisms for determining or addressing harms. This lack of consensus has resulted in a number of collective actions by workers protesting how harms are identified and addressed in their workplace. We theorize the role of workers within AI governance and construct a model of harm reporting processes in AI workplaces. The harm reporting process involves three steps, identification, the governance decision, and the response. Workers draw upon three types of claims to argue for jurisdiction over questions of AI governance, subjection, control over the product of labor, and proximate knowledge of systems. Examining the past decade of AI related worker activism allows us to understand how different types of workers are positioned within a workplace that produces AI systems, how their position informs their claims, and the place of collective action in staking their claims. This chapter argues that workers occupy a unique role in identifying and mitigating harms caused by AI systems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_245	What do Cyberpunk and AI Ethics have to do with each other? Cyberpunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that explores the post-human relationships between human experience and technology. One similarity between AI Ethics and Cyberpunk literature is that both seek to explore future social and ethical problems that our technological advances may bring upon society. In recent years, an increasing number of ethical matters involving AI have been pointed and debated, and several ethical principles and guides have been suggested as governance policies for the tech industry. However, would this be the role of AI Ethics? To serve as a soft and ambiguous version of the law? We would like to advocate in this article for a more Cyberpunk way of doing AI Ethics, with a more democratic way of governance. In this study, we will seek to expose some of the deficits of the underlying power structures of the AI industry, and suggest that AI governance be subject to public opinion, so that good AI can become good AI for all.

Arxiv_246	"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are experiencing widespread adoption in industry and academia. This has been driven by rapid advances in the applications and accuracy of AI through increasingly complex algorithms and models; this, in turn, has spurred research into specialized hardware AI accelerators. Given the rapid pace of advances, it is easy to forget that they are often developed and evaluated in a vacuum without considering the full application environment. This paper emphasizes the need for a holistic, end-to-end analysis of AI workloads and reveals the ""AI tax."" We deploy and characterize Face Recognition in an edge data center. The application is an AI-centric edge video analytics application built using popular open source infrastructure and ML tools. Despite using state-of-the-art AI and ML algorithms, the application relies heavily on pre-and post-processing code. As AI-centric applications benefit from the acceleration promised by accelerators, we find they impose stresses on the hardware and software infrastructure: storage and network bandwidth become major bottlenecks with increasing AI acceleration. By specializing for AI applications, we show that a purpose-built edge data center can be designed for the stresses of accelerated AI at 15% lower TCO than one derived from homogeneous servers and infrastructure."

Arxiv_247	In this chapter we argue that discourses on AI must transcend the language of 'ethics' and engage with power and political economy in order to constitute 'Good Data'. In particular, we must move beyond the depoliticised language of 'ethics' currently deployed (Wagner 2018) in determining whether AI is 'good' given the limitations of ethics as a frame through which AI issues can be viewed. In order to circumvent these limits, we use instead the language and conceptualisation of 'Good Data', as a more expansive term to elucidate the values, rights and interests at stake when it comes to AI's development and deployment, as well as that of other digital technologies. Good Data considerations move beyond recurring themes of data protection/privacy and the FAT (fairness, transparency and accountability) movement to include explicit political economy critiques of power. Instead of yet more ethics principles (that tend to say the same or similar things anyway), we offer four 'pillars' on which Good Data AI can be built: community, rights, usability and politics. Overall we view AI's 'goodness' as an explicly political (economy) question of power and one which is always related to the degree which AI is created and used to increase the wellbeing of society and especially to increase the power of the most marginalized and disenfranchised. We offer recommendations and remedies towards implementing 'better' approaches towards AI. Our strategies enable a different (but complementary) kind of evaluation of AI as part of the broader socio-technical systems in which AI is built and deployed.	Arxiv

AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state of the art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.

Arxiv_250	"In many contexts, lying -- the use of verbal falsehoods to deceive -- is harmful. While lying has traditionally been a human affair, AI systems that make sophisticated verbal statements are becoming increasingly prevalent. This raises the question of how we should limit the harm caused by AI ""lies"" (i.e. falsehoods that are actively selected for). Human truthfulness is governed by social norms and by laws (against defamation, perjury, and fraud). Differences between AI and humans present an opportunity to have more precise standards of truthfulness for AI, and to have these standards rise over time. This could provide significant benefits to public epistemics and the economy, and mitigate risks of worst-case AI futures.   Establishing norms or laws of AI truthfulness will require significant work to: (1) identify clear truthfulness standards; (2) create institutions that can judge adherence to those standards; and (3) develop AI systems that are robustly truthful.   Our initial proposals for these areas include: (1) a standard of avoiding ""negligent falsehoods"" (a generalisation of lies that is easier to assess); (2) institutions to evaluate AI systems before and after real-world deployment; and (3) explicitly training AI systems to be truthful via curated datasets and human interaction.   A concerning possibility is that evaluation mechanisms for eventual truthfulness standards could be captured by political interests, leading to harmful censorship and propaganda. Avoiding this might take careful attention. And since the scale of AI speech acts might grow dramatically over the coming decades, early truthfulness standards might be particularly important because of the precedents they set."	Arxiv
Arxiv_251	Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have become increasingly popular in many areas. Nevertheless, AI technologies are still in their developing stages, and many issues need to be addressed. Among those, the reliability of AI systems needs to be demonstrated so that the AI systems can be used with confidence by the general public. In this paper, we provide statistical perspectives on the reliability of AI systems. Different from other considerations, the reliability of AI systems focuses on the time dimension. That is, the system can perform its designed functionality for the intended period. We introduce a so-called SMART statistical framework for AI reliability research, which includes five components: Structure of the system, Metrics of reliability, Analysis of failure causes, Reliability assessment, and Test planning. We review traditional methods in reliability data analysis and software reliability, and discuss how those existing methods can be transformed for reliability modeling and assessment of AI systems. We also describe recent developments in modeling and analysis of AI reliability and outline statistical research challenges in this area, including out-of-distribution detection, the effect of the training set, adversarial attacks, model accuracy, and uncertainty quantification, and discuss how those topics can be related to AI reliability, with illustrative examples. Finally, we discuss data collection and test planning for AI reliability assessment and how to improve system designs for higher AI reliability. The paper closes with some concluding remarks.	Arxiv
Arxiv_252	Australia is a leading AI nation with strong allies and partnerships. Australia has prioritised the development of robotics, AI, and autonomous systems to develop sovereign capability for the military. Australia commits to Article 36 reviews of all new means and methods of warfare to ensure weapons and weapons systems are operated within acceptable systems of control. Additionally, Australia has undergone significant reviews of the risks of AI to human rights and within intelligence organisations and has committed to producing ethics guidelines and frameworks in Security and Defence. Australia is committed to OECD's values-based principles for the responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI as well as adopting a set of National AI ethics principles. While Australia has not adopted an AI governance framework specifically for the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO); Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) has published 'A Method for Ethical AI in Defence' (MEAID) technical report which includes a framework and pragmatic tools for managing ethical and legal risks for military applications of AI. Australia can play a leadership role by integrating legal and ethical considerations into its ADO AI capability acquisition process. This requires a policy framework that defines its legal and ethical requirements, is informed by Defence industry stakeholders, and provides a practical methodology to integrate legal and ethical risk mitigation strategies into the acquisition process.

Arxiv_253	Many important decisions in daily life are made with the help of advisors, e.g., decisions about medical treatments or financial investments. Whereas in the past, advice has often been received from human experts, friends, or family, advisors based on artificial intelligence (AI) have become more and more present nowadays. Typically, the advice generated by AI is judged by a human and either deemed reliable or rejected. However, recent work has shown that AI advice is not always beneficial, as humans have shown to be unable to ignore incorrect AI advice, essentially representing an over-reliance on AI. Therefore, the aspired goal should be to enable humans not to rely on AI advice blindly but rather to distinguish its quality and act upon it to make better decisions. Specifically, that means that humans should rely on the AI in the presence of correct advice and self-rely when confronted with incorrect advice, i.e., establish appropriate reliance (AR) on AI advice on a case-by-case basis. Current research lacks a metric for AR. This prevents a rigorous evaluation of factors impacting AR and hinders further development of human-AI decision-making. Therefore, based on the literature, we derive a measurement concept of AR. We propose to view AR as a two-dimensional construct that measures the ability to discriminate advice quality and behave accordingly. In this article, we derive the measurement concept, illustrate its application and outline potential future research.	Arxiv
Arxiv_254	Within the current AI ethics discourse, there is a gap in empirical research on understanding how AI practitioners understand ethics and socially organize to operationalize ethical concerns, particularly in the context of AI start-ups. This gap intensifies the risk of a disconnect between scholarly research, innovation, and application. This risk materializes acutely as mounting pressures to identify and mitigate the potential harms of AI systems have created an urgent need to assess and implement socio-technical innovation for fairness, accountability, and transparency. Building on social practice theory, we address this need via a framework that allows AI researchers, practitioners, and regulators to systematically analyze existing cultural understandings, histories, and social practices of ethical AI to define appropriate strategies for effectively implementing socio-technical innovations. Our contributions are threefold: 1) we introduce a practice-based approach for understanding ethical AI; 2) we present empirical findings from our study on the operationalization of ethics in German AI start-ups to underline that AI ethics and social practices must be understood in their specific cultural and historical contexts; and 3) based on our empirical findings, we suggest that ethical AI practices can be broken down into principles, needs, narratives, materializations, and cultural genealogies to form a useful backdrop for considering socio-technical innovations.

Arxiv_255	Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions and technologies are being increasingly adopted in smart systems context, however, such technologies are continuously concerned with ethical uncertainties. Various guidelines, principles, and regulatory frameworks are designed to ensure that AI technologies bring ethical well-being. However, the implications of AI ethics principles and guidelines are still being debated. To further explore the significance of AI ethics principles and relevant challenges, we conducted a survey of 99 representative AI practitioners and lawmakers (e.g., AI engineers, lawyers) from twenty countries across five continents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that encapsulates the perceptions of two different types of population (AI practitioners and lawmakers) and the study findings confirm that transparency, accountability, and privacy are the most critical AI ethics principles. On the other hand, lack of ethical knowledge, no legal frameworks, and lacking monitoring bodies are found the most common AI ethics challenges. The impact analysis of the challenges across AI ethics principles reveals that conflict in practice is a highly severe challenge. Moreover, the perceptions of practitioners and lawmakers are statistically correlated with significant differences for particular principles (e.g. fairness, freedom) and challenges (e.g. lacking monitoring bodies, machine distortion). Our findings stimulate further research, especially empowering existing capability maturity models to support the development and quality assessment of ethics-aware AI systems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_256	With increasing digitalization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous. AI-based systems to identify, optimize, automate, and scale solutions to complex economic and societal problems are being proposed and implemented. This has motivated regulation efforts, including the Proposal of an EU AI Act. This interdisciplinary position paper considers various concerns surrounding fairness and discrimination in AI, and discusses how AI regulations address them, focusing on (but not limited to) the Proposal. We first look at AI and fairness through the lenses of law, (AI) industry, sociotechnology, and (moral) philosophy, and present various perspectives. Then, we map these perspectives along three axes of interests: (i) Standardization vs. Localization, (ii) Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and (iii) Consequential vs. Deontological ethics which leads us to identify a pattern of common arguments and tensions between these axes. Positioning the discussion within the axes of interest and with a focus on reconciling the key tensions, we identify and propose the roles AI Regulation should take to make the endeavor of the AI Act a success in terms of AI fairness concerns.

Arxiv_257	Companies' adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming an essential element of business success. However, using AI poses new requirements for companies and their employees, including transparency and comprehensibility of AI systems. The field of Explainable AI (XAI) aims to address these issues. Yet, the current research primarily consists of laboratory studies, and there is a need to improve the applicability of the findings to real-world situations. Therefore, this project report paper provides insights into employees' needs and attitudes towards (X)AI. For this, we investigate employees' perspectives on (X)AI. Our findings suggest that AI and XAI are well-known terms perceived as important for employees. This recognition is a critical first step for XAI to potentially drive successful usage of AI by providing comprehensible insights into AI technologies. In a lessons-learned section, we discuss the open questions identified and suggest future research directions to develop human-centered XAI designs for companies. By providing insights into employees' needs and attitudes towards (X)AI, our project report contributes to the development of XAI solutions that meet the requirements of companies and their employees, ultimately driving the successful adoption of AI technologies in the business context.

Arxiv_258	The ability to discern between true and false information is essential to making sound decisions. However, with the recent increase in AI-based disinformation campaigns, it has become critical to understand the influence of deceptive systems on human information processing. In experiment (N=128), we investigated how susceptible people are to deceptive AI systems by examining how their ability to discern true news from fake news varies when AI systems are perceived as either human fact-checkers or AI fact-checking systems, and when explanations provided by those fact-checkers are either deceptive or honest. We find that deceitful explanations significantly reduce accuracy, indicating that people are just as likely to believe deceptive AI explanations as honest AI explanations. Although before getting assistance from an AI-system, people have significantly higher weighted discernment accuracy on false headlines than true headlines, we found that with assistance from an AI system, discernment accuracy increased significantly when given honest explanations on both true headlines and false headlines, and decreased significantly when given deceitful explanations on true headlines and false headlines. Further, we did not observe any significant differences in discernment between explanations perceived as coming from a human fact checker compared to an AI-fact checker. Similarly, we found no significant differences in trust. These findings exemplify the dangers of deceptive AI systems and the need for finding novel ways to limit their influence human information processing.	Arxiv
Arxiv_259	Scientists and philosophers have debated whether humans can trust advanced artificial intelligence (AI) agents to respect humanity's best interests. Yet what about the reverse? Will advanced AI agents trust humans? Gauging an AI agent's trust in humans is challenging because--absent costs for dishonesty--such agents might respond falsely about their trust in humans. Here we present a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering an AI agent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. In two separate experiments, we then employ this method in hundreds of trust games between an AI agent (a Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI) and a human experimenter (author TJ). In our first experiment, we find that the AI agent decides to trust humans at higher rates when facing actual incentives than when making hypothetical decisions. Our second experiment replicates and extends these findings by automating game play and by homogenizing question wording. We again observe higher rates of trust when the AI agent faces real incentives. Across both experiments, the AI agent's trust decisions appear unrelated to the magnitude of stakes. Furthermore, to address the possibility that the AI agent's trust decisions reflect a preference for uncertainty, the experiments include two conditions that present the AI agent with a non-social decision task that provides the opportunity to choose a certain or uncertain option; in those conditions, the AI agent consistently chooses the certain option. Our experiments suggest that one of the most advanced AI language models to date alters its social behavior in response to incentives and displays behavior consistent with trust toward a human interlocutor when incentivized.

Arxiv_260	Persuasion is a key aspect of what it means to be human, and is central to business, politics, and other endeavors. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have produced AI systems that are capable of persuading humans to buy products, watch videos, click on search results, and more. Even systems that are not explicitly designed to persuade may do so in practice. In the future, increasingly anthropomorphic AI systems may form ongoing relationships with users, increasing their persuasive power. This paper investigates the uncertain future of persuasive AI systems. We examine ways that AI could qualitatively alter our relationship to and views regarding persuasion by shifting the balance of persuasive power, allowing personalized persuasion to be deployed at scale, powering misinformation campaigns, and changing the way humans can shape their own discourse. We consider ways AI-driven persuasion could differ from human-driven persuasion. We warn that ubiquitous highlypersuasive AI systems could alter our information environment so significantly so as to contribute to a loss of human control of our own future. In response, we examine several potential responses to AI-driven persuasion: prohibition, identification of AI agents, truthful AI, and legal remedies. We conclude that none of these solutions will be airtight, and that individuals and governments will need to take active steps to guard against the most pernicious effects of persuasive AI.	Arxiv
Arxiv_261	The significant advancements in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to healthcare decision-making, medical diagnosis, and other domains have simultaneously raised concerns about the fairness and bias of AI systems. This is particularly critical in areas like healthcare, employment, criminal justice, credit scoring, and increasingly, in generative AI models (GenAI) that produce synthetic media. Such systems can lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate existing inequalities, including generative biases that affect the representation of individuals in synthetic data. This survey paper offers a succinct, comprehensive overview of fairness and bias in AI, addressing their sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies. We review sources of bias, such as data, algorithm, and human decision biases - highlighting the emergent issue of generative AI bias where models may reproduce and amplify societal stereotypes. We assess the societal impact of biased AI systems, focusing on the perpetuation of inequalities and the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes, especially as generative AI becomes more prevalent in creating content that influences public perception. We explore various proposed mitigation strategies, discussing the ethical considerations of their implementation and emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure effectiveness. Through a systematic literature review spanning multiple academic disciplines, we present definitions of AI bias and its different types, including a detailed look at generative AI bias. We discuss the negative impacts of AI bias on individuals and society and provide an overview of current approaches to mitigate AI bias, including data pre-processing, model selection, and post-processing. We emphasize the unique challenges presented by generative AI models and the importance of strategies specifically tailored to address these.	Arxiv
Arxiv_262	"Over the past half century, there have been several false dawns during which the ""arrival"" of world-changing artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded. Tempting fate, the authors believe the age of AI has, indeed, finally arrived. Powerful image generators, such as DALL-E2 and Midjourney have suddenly allowed anyone with access the ability easily to create rich and complex art. In a similar vein, text generators, such as GPT3.5 (including ChatGPT) and BLOOM, allow users to compose detailed written descriptions of many topics of interest. And, it is even possible now for a person without extensive expertise in writing software to use AI to generate code capable of myriad applications. While AI will continue to evolve and improve, probably at a rapid rate, the current state of AI is already ushering in profound changes to many different sectors of society. Every new technology challenges the ability of humanity to govern it wisely. However, governance is usually viewed as both possible and necessary due to the disruption new technology often poses to social structures, industries, the environment, and other important human concerns. In this article, we offer an analysis of a range of interactions between AI and governance, with the hope that wise decisions may be made that maximize benefits and minimize costs. The article addresses two main aspects of this relationship: the governance of AI by humanity, and the governance of humanity by AI. The approach we have taken is itself informed by AI, as this article was written collaboratively by the authors and ChatGPT."	Arxiv
Arxiv_263	Despite its successes, to date Artificial Intelligence (AI) is still characterized by a number of shortcomings with regards to different application domains and goals. These limitations are arguably both conceptual (e.g., related to underlying theoretical models, such as symbolic vs. connectionist), and operational (e.g., related to robustness and ability to generalize). Biologically inspired AI, and more specifically brain-inspired AI, promises to provide further biological aspects beyond those that are already traditionally included in AI, making it possible to assess and possibly overcome some of its present shortcomings. This article examines some conceptual, technical, and ethical issues raised by the development and use of brain-inspired AI. Against this background, the paper asks whether there is anything ethically unique about brain-inspired AI. The aim of the paper is to introduce a method that has a heuristic nature and that can be applied to identify and address the ethical issues arising from brain-inspired AI. The conclusion resulting from the application of this method is that, compared to traditional AI, brain-inspired AI raises new foundational ethical issues and some new practical ethical issues, and exacerbates some of the issues raised by traditional AI.

Arxiv_264	As the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow, policymakers are increasingly grappling with the question of how to regulate this technology. The most far-reaching international initiative is the European Union (EU) AI Act, which aims to establish the first comprehensive, binding framework for regulating AI. In this article, we offer the first systematic analysis of non-state actor preferences toward international regulation of AI, focusing on the case of the EU AI Act. Theoretically, we develop an argument about the regulatory preferences of business actors and other non-state actors under varying conditions of AI sector competitiveness. Empirically, we test these expectations using data from public consultations on European AI regulation. Our findings are threefold. First, all types of non-state actors express concerns about AI and support regulation in some form. Second, there are nonetheless significant differences across actor types, with business actors being less concerned about the downsides of AI and more in favor of lax regulation than other non-state actors. Third, these differences are more pronounced in countries with stronger commercial AI sectors. Our findings shed new light on non-state actor preferences toward AI regulation and point to challenges for policymakers balancing competing interests in society.	Arxiv
Arxiv_265	Current proposals for AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, aim to spur AI that is trustworthy (e.g., AI Act) and accountable (e.g., AI Liability) What is missing, however, is a robust regulatory discourse and roadmap to make AI, and technology more broadly, environmentally sustainable. This paper aims to take first steps to fill this gap. The ICT sector contributes up to 3.9 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-more than global air travel at 2.5 percent. The carbon footprint and water consumption of AI, especially large-scale generative models like GPT-4, raise significant sustainability concerns. The paper is the first to assess how current and proposed technology regulations, including EU environmental law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the AI Act, could be adjusted to better account for environmental sustainability. The GDPR, for instance, could be interpreted to limit certain individual rights like the right to erasure if these rights significantly conflict with broader sustainability goals. In a second step, the paper suggests a multi-faceted approach to achieve sustainable AI regulation. It advocates for transparency mechanisms, such as disclosing the GHG footprint of AI systems, as laid out in the proposed EU AI Act. However, sustainable AI regulation must go beyond mere transparency. The paper proposes a regulatory toolkit comprising co-regulation, sustainability-by-design principles, restrictions on training data, and consumption caps, including integration into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Finally, the paper argues that this regulatory toolkit could serve as a blueprint for regulating other high-emission technologies and infrastructures like blockchain, Metaverse applications, and data centers. The framework aims to cohesively address the crucial dual challenges of our era: digital transformation and climate change mitigation.	Arxiv
Arxiv_266	"Analysing historical patterns of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption can inform decisions about AI capability uplift, but research to date has provided a limited view of AI adoption across various fields of research. In this study we examine worldwide adoption of AI technology within 333 fields of research during 1960-2021. We do this by using bibliometric analysis with 137 million peer-reviewed publications captured in The Lens database. We define AI using a list of 214 phrases developed by expert working groups at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We found that 3.1 million of the 137 million peer-reviewed research publications during the entire period were AI-related, with a surge in AI adoption across practically all research fields (physical science, natural science, life science, social science and the arts and humanities) in recent years. The diffusion of AI beyond computer science was early, rapid and widespread. In 1960 14% of 333 research fields were related to AI (many in computer science), but this increased to cover over half of all research fields by 1972, over 80% by 1986 and over 98% in current times. We note AI has experienced boom-bust cycles historically: the AI ""springs"" and ""winters"". We conclude that the context of the current surge appears different, and that interdisciplinary AI application is likely to be sustained."	Arxiv
Arxiv_267	Uses of artificial intelligence (AI), especially those powered by machine learning approaches, are growing in sectors and societies around the world. How will AI adoption proceed, especially in the international security realm? Research on automation bias suggests that humans can often be overconfident in AI, whereas research on algorithm aversion shows that, as the stakes of a decision rise, humans become more cautious about trusting algorithms. We theorize about the relationship between background knowledge about AI, trust in AI, and how these interact with other factors to influence the probability of automation bias in the international security context. We test these in a preregistered task identification experiment across a representative sample of 9000 adults in 9 countries with varying levels of AI industries. The results strongly support the theory, especially concerning AI background knowledge. A version of the Dunning Kruger effect appears to be at play, whereby those with the lowest level of experience with AI are slightly more likely to be algorithm-averse, then automation bias occurs at lower levels of knowledge before leveling off as a respondent's AI background reaches the highest levels. Additional results show effects from the task's difficulty, overall AI trust, and whether a human or AI decision aid is described as highly competent or less competent.	Arxiv
Arxiv_268	Current progress in the artificial intelligence domain has led to the development of various types of AI-powered dementia assessments, which can be employed to identify patients at the early stage of dementia. It can revolutionize the dementia care settings. It is essential that the medical community be aware of various AI assessments and choose them considering their degrees of validity, efficiency, practicality, reliability, and accuracy concerning the early identification of patients with dementia (PwD). On the other hand, AI developers should be informed about various non-AI assessments as well as recently developed AI assessments. Thus, this paper, which can be readable by both clinicians and AI engineers, fills the gap in the literature in explaining the existing solutions for the recognition of dementia to clinicians, as well as the techniques used and the most widespread dementia datasets to AI engineers. It follows a review of papers on AI and non-AI assessments for dementia to provide valuable information about various dementia assessments for both the AI and medical communities. The discussion and conclusion highlight the most prominent research directions and the maturity of existing solutions.	Arxiv
Arxiv_269	Explainability techniques are rapidly being developed to improve human-AI decision-making across various cooperative work settings. Consequently, previous research has evaluated how decision-makers collaborate with imperfect AI by investigating appropriate reliance and task performance with the aim of designing more human-centered computer-supported collaborative tools. Several human-centered explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed in hopes of improving decision-makers' collaboration with AI; however, these techniques are grounded in findings from previous studies that primarily focus on the impact of incorrect AI advice. Few studies acknowledge the possibility for the explanations to be incorrect even if the AI advice is correct. Thus, it is crucial to understand how imperfect XAI affects human-AI decision-making. In this work, we contribute a robust, mixed-methods user study with 136 participants to evaluate how incorrect explanations influence humans' decision-making behavior in a bird species identification task taking into account their level of expertise and an explanation's level of assertiveness. Our findings reveal the influence of imperfect XAI and humans' level of expertise on their reliance on AI and human-AI team performance. We also discuss how explanations can deceive decision-makers during human-AI collaboration. Hence, we shed light on the impacts of imperfect XAI in the field of computer-supported cooperative work and provide guidelines for designers of human-AI collaboration systems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_270	"A growing body of research has explored how to support humans in making better use of AI-based decision support, including via training and onboarding. Existing research has focused on decision-making tasks where it is possible to evaluate ""appropriate reliance"" by comparing each decision against a ground truth label that cleanly maps to both the AI's predictive target and the human decision-maker's goals. However, this assumption does not hold in many real-world settings where AI tools are deployed today (e.g., social work, criminal justice, and healthcare). In this paper, we introduce a process-oriented notion of appropriate reliance called critical use that centers the human's ability to situate AI predictions against knowledge that is uniquely available to them but unavailable to the AI model. To explore how training can support critical use, we conduct a randomized online experiment in a complex social decision-making setting: child maltreatment screening. We find that, by providing participants with accelerated, low-stakes opportunities to practice AI-assisted decision-making in this setting, novices came to exhibit patterns of disagreement with AI that resemble those of experienced workers. A qualitative examination of participants' explanations for their AI-assisted decisions revealed that they drew upon qualitative case narratives, to which the AI model did not have access, to learn when (not) to rely on AI predictions. Our findings open new questions for the study and design of training for real-world AI-assisted decision-making."	Arxiv
Arxiv_271	This report examines Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the financial sector, outlining its potential to revolutionise the industry and identify its challenges. It underscores the criticality of a well-rounded understanding of AI, its capabilities, and its implications to effectively leverage its potential while mitigating associated risks. The potential of AI potential extends from augmenting existing operations to paving the way for novel applications in the finance sector. The application of AI in the financial sector is transforming the industry. Its use spans areas from customer service enhancements, fraud detection, and risk management to credit assessments and high-frequency trading. However, along with these benefits, AI also presents several challenges. These include issues related to transparency, interpretability, fairness, accountability, and trustworthiness. The use of AI in the financial sector further raises critical questions about data privacy and security. A further issue identified in this report is the systemic risk that AI can introduce to the financial sector. Being prone to errors, AI can exacerbate existing systemic risks, potentially leading to financial crises. Regulation is crucial to harnessing the benefits of AI while mitigating its potential risks. Despite the global recognition of this need, there remains a lack of clear guidelines or legislation for AI use in finance. This report discusses key principles that could guide the formation of effective AI regulation in the financial sector, including the need for a risk-based approach, the inclusion of ethical considerations, and the importance of maintaining a balance between innovation and consumer protection. The report provides recommendations for academia, the finance industry, and regulators.	Arxiv
Arxiv_272	Although artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved many feats at a rapid pace, there still exist open problems and fundamental shortcomings related to performance and resource efficiency. Since AI researchers benchmark a significant proportion of performance standards through human intelligence, cognitive sciences-inspired AI is a promising domain of research. Studying cognitive science can provide a fresh perspective to building fundamental blocks in AI research, which can lead to improved performance and efficiency. In this review paper, we focus on the cognitive functions of perception, which is the process of taking signals from one's surroundings as input, and processing them to understand the environment. Particularly, we study and compare its various processes through the lens of both cognitive sciences and AI. Through this study, we review all current major theories from various sub-disciplines of cognitive science (specifically neuroscience, psychology and linguistics), and draw parallels with theories and techniques from current practices in AI. We, hence, present a detailed collection of methods in AI for researchers to build AI systems inspired by cognitive science. Further, through the process of reviewing the state of cognitive-inspired AI, we point out many gaps in the current state of AI (with respect to the performance of the human brain), and hence present potential directions for researchers to develop better perception systems in AI.

Arxiv_273	"This position paper explores the broad landscape of AI potentiality in the context of cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis on its possible risk factors with awareness, which can be managed by incorporating human experts in the loop, i.e., ""Human-AI"" teaming. As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies advance, they will provide unparalleled opportunities for attack identification, incident response, and recovery. However, the successful deployment of AI into cybersecurity measures necessitates an in-depth understanding of its capabilities, challenges, and ethical and legal implications to handle associated risk factors in real-world application areas. Towards this, we emphasize the importance of a balanced approach that incorporates AI's computational power with human expertise. AI systems may proactively discover vulnerabilities and detect anomalies through pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, significantly enhancing speed and accuracy. Human experts can explain AI-generated decisions to stakeholders, regulators, and end-users in critical situations, ensuring responsibility and accountability, which helps establish trust in AI-driven security solutions. Therefore, in this position paper, we argue that human-AI teaming is worthwhile in cybersecurity, in which human expertise such as intuition, critical thinking, or contextual understanding is combined with AI's computational power to improve overall cyber defenses."

Arxiv_275	AI's impact has traditionally been assessed in terms of occupations. However, an occupation is comprised of interconnected tasks, and it is these tasks, not occupations themselves, that are affected by AI. To evaluate how tasks may be impacted, previous approaches utilized manual annotations or coarse-grained matching. Leveraging recent advancements in machine learning, we replace coarse-grained matching with more precise deep learning approaches. Introducing the AI Impact (AII) measure, we employ Deep Learning Natural Language Processing to automatically identify AI patents that impact various occupational tasks at scale. Our methodology relies on a comprehensive dataset of 19,498 task descriptions and quantifies AI's impact through analysis of 12,984 AI patents filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 2015 and 2020. Our observations reveal that the impact of AI on occupations defies simplistic categorizations based on task complexity, challenging the conventional belief that the dichotomy between basic and advanced skills alone explains the effects of AI. Instead, the impact is intricately linked to specific skills, whether basic or advanced, associated with particular tasks. For instance, while basic skills like scanning items may be affected, others like cooking may not. Similarly, certain advanced skills, such as image analysis in radiology, may face impact, while skills involving interpersonal relationships may remain unaffected. Furthermore, the influence of AI extends beyond knowledge-centric regions. Regions in the U.S. that heavily rely on industries susceptible to AI changes, often characterized by economic inequality or a lack of economic diversification, will experience notable AI impact.

Arxiv_276	As Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have become more powerful and easier to use they are increasingly deployed as key components of modern software systems. While this enables new functionality and often allows better adaptation to user needs it also creates additional problems for software engineers and exposes companies to new risks. Some work has been done to better understand the interaction between Software Engineering and AI but we lack methods to classify ways of applying AI in software systems and to analyse and understand the risks this poses. Only by doing so can we devise tools and solutions to help mitigate them. This paper presents the AI in SE Application Levels (AI-SEAL) taxonomy that categorises applications according to their point of AI application, the type of AI technology used and the automation level allowed. We show the usefulness of this taxonomy by classifying 15 papers from previous editions of the RAISE workshop. Results show that the taxonomy allows classification of distinct AI applications and provides insights concerning the risks associated with them. We argue that this will be important for companies in deciding how to apply AI in their software applications and to create strategies for its use.	Arxiv

In this paper, we formally describe one such impossibility result, namely Unpredictability of AI. We prove that it is impossible to precisely and consistently predict what specific actions a smarter-than-human intelligent system will take to achieve its objectives, even if we know terminal goals of the system. In conclusion, impact of Unpredictability on AI Safety is discussed.	Arxiv
Arxiv_278	AI Ethics is now a global topic of discussion in academic and policy circles. At least 84 public-private initiatives have produced statements describing high-level principles, values, and other tenets to guide the ethical development, deployment, and governance of AI. According to recent meta-analyses, AI Ethics has seemingly converged on a set of principles that closely resemble the four classic principles of medical ethics. Despite the initial credibility granted to a principled approach to AI Ethics by the connection to principles in medical ethics, there are reasons to be concerned about its future impact on AI development and governance. Significant differences exist between medicine and AI development that suggest a principled approach in the latter may not enjoy success comparable to the former. Compared to medicine, AI development lacks (1) common aims and fiduciary duties, (2) professional history and norms, (3) proven methods to translate principles into practice, and (4) robust legal and professional accountability mechanisms. These differences suggest we should not yet celebrate consensus around high-level principles that hide deep political and normative disagreement.	Arxiv
Arxiv_279	Recently, a lot of attention has been given to undesired consequences of Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as unfair bias leading to discrimination, or the lack of explanations of the results of AI systems. There are several important questions to answer before AI can be deployed at scale in our businesses and societies. Most of these issues are being discussed by experts and the wider communities, and it seems there is broad consensus on where they come from. There is, however, less consensus on, and experience with how to practically deal with those issues in organizations that develop and use AI, both from a technical and organizational perspective. In this paper, we discuss the practical case of a large organization that is putting in place a company-wide methodology to minimize the risk of undesired consequences of AI. We hope that other organizations can learn from this and that our experience contributes to making the best of AI while minimizing its risks.	Arxiv
Arxiv_280	As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology gets more intertwined with every system, people are using AI to make decisions on their everyday activities. In simple contexts, such as Netflix recommendations, or in more complex context like in judicial scenarios, AI is part of people's decisions. People make decisions and usually, they need to explain their decision to others or in some matter. It is particularly critical in contexts where human expertise is central to decision-making. In order to explain their decisions with AI support, people need to understand how AI is part of that decision. When considering the aspect of fairness, the role that AI has on a decision-making process becomes even more sensitive since it affects the fairness and the responsibility of those people making the ultimate decision. We have been exploring an evidence-based explanation design approach to 'tell the story of a decision'. In this position paper, we discuss our approach for AI systems using fairness sensitive cases in the literature.	Arxiv
Arxiv_281	Despite the promises of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI), little is known about how we can bridge the gulf between traditional physician-driven diagnosis and a plausible future of medicine automated by AI. Specifically, how can we involve AI usefully in physicians' diagnosis workflow given that most AI is still nascent and error-prone (e.g., in digital pathology)? To explore this question, we first propose a series of collaborative techniques to engage human pathologists with AI given AI's capabilities and limitations, based on which we prototype Impetus - a tool where an AI takes various degrees of initiatives to provide various forms of assistance to a pathologist in detecting tumors from histological slides. We summarize observations and lessons learned from a study with eight pathologists and discuss recommendations for future work on human-centered medical AI systems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_282	Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become increasingly vital in the development of novel defense and intelligence capabilities across all domains of warfare. An adversarial AI (A2I) and adversarial ML (AML) attack seeks to deceive and manipulate AI/ML models. It is imperative that AI/ML models can defend against these attacks. A2I/AML defenses will help provide the necessary assurance of these advanced capabilities that use AI/ML models. The A2I Working Group (A2IWG) seeks to advance the research and development of assured AI/ML capabilities via new A2I/AML defenses by fostering a collaborative environment across the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Intelligence Community. The A2IWG aims to identify specific challenges that it can help solve or address more directly, with initial focus on three topics: AI Trusted Robustness, AI System Security, and AI/ML Architecture Vulnerabilities.

Arxiv_283	Neural nets, one of the oldest architectures for AI programming, are loosely based on biological neurons and their properties. Recent work on language applications has made the AI code closer to biological reality in several ways. This commentary examines this convergence and, in light of what is known of neocortical structure, addresses the question of whether ``general AI'' looks attainable with these tools.	Arxiv
Arxiv_284	Over the past three years we have built a practice-oriented, bachelor level, educational programme for software engineers to specialize as AI engineers. The experience with this programme and the practical assignments our students execute in industry has given us valuable insights on the profession of AI engineer. In this paper we discuss our programme and the lessons learned for industry and research.	Arxiv
Arxiv_285	Along with the development of modern computing technology and social sciences, both theoretical research and practical applications of social computing have been continuously extended. In particular with the boom of artificial intelligence (AI), social computing is significantly influenced by AI. However, the conventional technologies of AI have drawbacks in dealing with more complicated and dynamic problems. Such deficiency can be rectified by hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI) which integrates both human intelligence and AI into one unity, forming a new enhanced intelligence. H-AI in dealing with social problems shows the advantages that AI can not surpass. This paper firstly introduces the concept of H-AI. AI is the intelligence in the transition stage of H-AI, so the latest research progresses of AI in social computing are reviewed. Secondly, it summarizes typical challenges faced by AI in social computing, and makes it possible to introduce H-AI to solve these challenges. Finally, the paper proposes a holistic framework of social computing combining with H-AI, which consists of four layers: object layer, base layer, analysis layer, and application layer. It represents H-AI has significant advantages over AI in solving social problems.	Arxiv
Arxiv_286	Artificial intelligence (AI) systems operate in increasingly diverse areas, from healthcare to facial recognition, the stock market, autonomous vehicles, and so on. While the underlying digital infrastructure of AI systems is developing rapidly, each area of implementation is subject to different degrees and processes of legitimization. By combining elements from institutional theory and information systems-theory, this paper presents a conceptual framework to analyze and understand AI-induced field-change. The introduction of novel AI-agents into new or existing fields creates a dynamic in which algorithms (re)shape organizations and institutions while existing institutional infrastructures determine the scope and speed at which organizational change is allowed to occur. Where institutional infrastructure and governance arrangements, such as standards, rules, and regulations, still are unelaborate, the field can move fast but is also more likely to be contested. The institutional infrastructure surrounding AI-induced fields is generally little elaborated, which could be an obstacle to the broader institutionalization of AI-systems going forward.	Arxiv
Arxiv_287	Drawing on our experience of more than a decade of AI in academic research, technology development, industry engagement, postgraduate teaching, doctoral supervision and organisational consultancy, we present the 'CDAC AI Life Cycle', a comprehensive life cycle for the design, development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and solutions. It consists of three phases, Design, Develop and Deploy, and 17 constituent stages across the three phases from conception to production of any AI initiative. The 'Design' phase highlights the importance of contextualising a problem description by reviewing public domain and service-based literature on state-of-the-art AI applications, algorithms, pre-trained models and equally importantly ethics guidelines and frameworks, which then informs the data, or Big Data, acquisition and preparation. The 'Develop' phase is technique-oriented, as it transforms data and algorithms into AI models that are benchmarked, evaluated and explained. The 'Deploy' phase evaluates computational performance, which then apprises pipelines for model operationalisation, culminating in the hyperautomation of a process or system as a complete AI solution, that is continuously monitored and evaluated to inform the next iteration of the life cycle. An ontological mapping of AI algorithms to applications, followed by an organisational context for the AI life cycle are further contributions of this article.	Arxiv
Arxiv_288	Solidarity is one of the fundamental values at the heart of the construction of peaceful societies and present in more than one third of world's constitutions. Still, solidarity is almost never included as a principle in ethical guidelines for the development of AI. Solidarity as an AI principle (1) shares the prosperity created by AI, implementing mechanisms to redistribute the augmentation of productivity for all; and shares the burdens, making sure that AI does not increase inequality and no human is left behind. Solidarity as an AI principle (2) assesses the long term implications before developing and deploying AI systems so no groups of humans become irrelevant because of AI systems. Considering solidarity as a core principle for AI development will provide not just an human-centric but a more humanity-centric approach to AI.	Arxiv
Arxiv_289	With increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern societies, individual countries and the international community are working hard to create an innovation-friendly, yet safe, regulatory environment. Adequate regulation is key to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks stemming from AI technologies. Developing regulatory frameworks is, however, challenging due to AI's global reach and the existence of widespread misconceptions about the notion of regulation. We argue that AI-related challenges cannot be tackled effectively without sincere international coordination supported by robust, consistent domestic and international governance arrangements. Against this backdrop, we propose the establishment of an international AI governance framework organized around a new AI regulatory agency that -- drawing on interdisciplinary expertise -- could help creating uniform standards for the regulation of AI technologies and inform the development of AI policies around the world. We also believe that a fundamental change of mindset on what constitutes regulation is necessary to remove existing barriers that hamper contemporary efforts to develop AI regulatory regimes, and put forward some recommendations on how to achieve this, and what opportunities doing so would present.

Arxiv_290	Several seminal ethics initiatives have stipulated sets of principles and standards for good technology development in the AI sector. However, widespread criticism has pointed out a lack of practical realization of these principles. Following that, AI ethics underwent a practical turn, but without deviating from the principled approach and the many shortcomings associated with it. This paper proposes a different approach. It defines four basic AI virtues, namely justice, honesty, responsibility and care, all of which represent specific motivational settings that constitute the very precondition for ethical decision making in the AI field. Moreover, it defines two second-order AI virtues, prudence and fortitude, that bolster achieving the basic virtues by helping with overcoming bounded ethicality or the many hidden psychological forces that impair ethical decision making and that are hitherto disregarded in AI ethics. Lastly, the paper describes measures for successfully cultivating the mentioned virtues in organizations dealing with AI research and development.	Arxiv
Arxiv_291	As AI becomes integrated throughout the world, its potential for impact within low-resource regions around the Global South have grown. AI research labs from tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and IBM have a significant presence in countries such as India, Ghana, and South Africa. The work done by these labs is often motivated by the potential impact it could have on local populations, but the deployment of these tools has not always gone smoothly. This paper presents a case study examining the deployment of AI by large industry labs situated in low-resource contexts, highlights factors impacting unanticipated deployments, and reflects on the state of AI deployment within the Global South, providing suggestions that embrace inclusive design methodologies within AI development that prioritize the needs of marginalized communities and elevate their status not just as beneficiaries of AI systems but as primary stakeholders.

Arxiv_292	The development of AI applications is a multidisciplinary effort, involving multiple roles collaborating with the AI developers, an umbrella term we use to include data scientists and other AI-adjacent roles on the same team. During these collaborations, there is a knowledge mismatch between AI developers, who are skilled in data science, and external stakeholders who are typically not. This difference leads to communication gaps, and the onus falls on AI developers to explain data science concepts to their collaborators. In this paper, we report on a study including analyses of both interviews with AI developers and artifacts they produced for communication. Using the analytic lens of shared mental models, we report on the types of communication gaps that AI developers face, how AI developers communicate across disciplinary and organizational boundaries, and how they simultaneously manage issues regarding trust and expectations.

Arxiv_293	The number and importance of AI-based systems in all domains is growing. With the pervasive use and the dependence on AI-based systems, the quality of these systems becomes essential for their practical usage. However, quality assurance for AI-based systems is an emerging area that has not been well explored and requires collaboration between the SE and AI research communities. This paper discusses terminology and challenges on quality assurance for AI-based systems to set a baseline for that purpose. Therefore, we define basic concepts and characterize AI-based systems along the three dimensions of artifact type, process, and quality characteristics. Furthermore, we elaborate on the key challenges of (1) understandability and interpretability of AI models, (2) lack of specifications and defined requirements, (3) need for validation data and test input generation, (4) defining expected outcomes as test oracles, (5) accuracy and correctness measures, (6) non-functional properties of AI-based systems, (7) self-adaptive and self-learning characteristics, and (8) dynamic and frequently changing environments.

Arxiv_294	In this paper, we demonstrate the design of efficient and high-performance AI/Deep Learning accelerators with customized STT-MRAM and a reconfigurable core. Based on model-driven detailed design space exploration, we present the design methodology of an innovative scratchpad-assisted on-chip STT-MRAM based buffer system for high-performance accelerators. Using analytically derived expression of memory occupancy time of AI model weights and activation maps, the volatility of STT-MRAM is adjusted with process and temperature variation aware scaling of thermal stability factor to optimize the retention time, energy, read/write latency, and area of STT-MRAM. From the analysis of modern AI workloads and accelerator implementation in 14nm technology, we verify the efficacy of our designed AI accelerator with STT-MRAM STT-AI. Compared to an SRAM-based implementation, the STT-AI accelerator achieves 75% area and 3% power savings at iso-accuracy. Furthermore, with a relaxed bit error rate and negligible AI accuracy trade-off, the designed STT-AI Ultra accelerator achieves 75.4%, and 3.5% savings in area and power, respectively over regular SRAM-based accelerators.

Arxiv_295	In this work, we survey skepticism regarding AI risk and show parallels with other types of scientific skepticism. We start by classifying different types of AI Risk skepticism and analyze their root causes. We conclude by suggesting some intervention approaches, which may be successful in reducing AI risk skepticism, at least amongst artificial intelligence researchers.	Arxiv
Arxiv_296	What we expect from radiology AI algorithms will shape the selection and implementation of AI in the radiologic practice. In this paper I consider prevailing expectations of AI and compare them to expectations that we have of human readers. I observe that the expectations from AI and radiologists are fundamentally different. The expectations of AI are based on a strong and justified mistrust about the way that AI makes decisions. Because AI decisions are not well understood, it is difficult to know how the algorithms will behave in new, unexpected situations. However, this mistrust is not mirrored in our expectations of human readers. Despite well-proven idiosyncrasies and biases in human decision making, we take comfort from the assumption that others make decisions in a way as we do, and we trust our own decision making. Despite poor ability to explain decision making processes in humans, we accept explanations of decisions given by other humans. Because the goal of radiology is the most accurate radiologic interpretation, our expectations of radiologists and AI should be similar, and both should reflect a healthy mistrust of complicated and partially opaque decision processes undergoing in computer algorithms and human brains. This is generally not the case now.	Arxiv
Arxiv_297	As artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed, principles for ethical AI are also proliferating. Certification offers a method to both incentivize adoption of these principles and substantiate that they have been implemented in practice. This paper draws from management literature on certification and reviews current AI certification programs and proposals. Successful programs rely on both emerging technical methods and specific design considerations. In order to avoid two common failures of certification, program designs should ensure that the symbol of the certification is substantially implemented in practice and that the program achieves its stated goals. The review indicates that the field currently focuses on self-certification and third-party certification of systems, individuals, and organizations - to the exclusion of process management certifications. Additionally, the paper considers prospects for future AI certification programs. Ongoing changes in AI technology suggest that AI certification regimes should be designed to emphasize governance criteria of enduring value, such as ethics training for AI developers, and to adjust technical criteria as the technology changes. Overall, certification can play a valuable mix in the portfolio of AI governance tools.	Arxiv
Arxiv_298	In recent years, there has been an increased emphasis on understanding and mitigating adverse impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on society. Across academia, industry, and government bodies, a variety of endeavours are being pursued towards enhancing AI ethics. A significant challenge in the design of ethical AI systems is that there are multiple stakeholders in the AI pipeline, each with their own set of constraints and interests. These different perspectives are often not understood, due in part to communication gaps.For example, AI researchers who design and develop AI models are not necessarily aware of the instability induced in consumers' lives by the compounded effects of AI decisions. Educating different stakeholders about their roles and responsibilities in the broader context becomes necessary. In this position paper, we outline some potential ways in which generative artworks can play this role by serving as accessible and powerful educational tools for surfacing different perspectives. We hope to spark interdisciplinary discussions about computational creativity broadly as a tool for enhancing AI ethics.	Arxiv
Arxiv_299	The received wisdom is that artificial intelligence (AI) is a competition between the US and China. In this chapter, the author will examine how the European Union (EU) fits into that mix and what it can offer as a third way to govern AI. The chapter presents this by exploring the past, present and future of AI governance in the EU. Section 1 serves to explore and evidence the EUs coherent and comprehensive approach to AI governance. In short, the EU ensures and encourages ethical, trustworthy and reliable technological development. This will cover a range of key documents and policy tools that lead to the most crucial effort of the EU to date: to regulate AI. Section 2 maps the EUs drive towards digital sovereignty through the lens of regulation and infrastructure. This covers topics such as the trustworthiness of AI systems, cloud, compute and foreign direct investment. In Section 3, the chapter concludes by offering several considerations to achieve good AI governance in the EU.	Arxiv
